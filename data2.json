Finally, it will explain the circuit of Switched-CAPACITOR CIRCUITS and Comparators.Class method: Use a little chaotic self -edited lectures to class. There are several textbooks used for reference. The school has a license to download.Exam operation: One final exam, Open Computer (during the epidemic period), there are not many questions, and the scores are not difficult to get.A total of five homework plus the final topic.The first four times are Matlab and Simulink's exercises.

The fifth and end -of -the -end topic must use Virtuoso's ideal component Macro Model to make a PIPELINE ADC.The homework will provide simple examples or teaching, but it feels that the sources of these examples are different. They have not been sorted out. It usually takes some time to explore to understand.Other: No name.The basic knowledge of AIC and signals and systems will be used, but it will not be very deep.In the end, what I want to say: It seems to be known as a small DCIC, but I always feel that the curriculum arrangement is a bit followed, as if the teacher teaches whatever you think of, and maybe you are afraid that you ca n\u2019t absorb too much. It is easy to hear distractions.However, the teacher is very good. You can take a few more XDD homework and test questions for you. Occasionally, there are occasional small bugs. It will be quite irritable at the moment, but in the end, there is something to learn.It's a pity not to talk about the Delta-Sigma ADC that the teacher is best at.The distance of the course was one year later, and there was still an epidemic at the time, so many things may be different, for reference only ~-"}, {"text": "Class name: Computer Structure, Professor: Liu Zhiwei, what did you teach: Introduce the basic concepts of computer structure, you can have to have a textbook without the foundation.

Explain the clear foundation.Class method: Except for some computers to clearly can clearly conveyed pictures (the teacher's version of the book is really good), every time you class, you will avoid rubbing the black version.In addition, the teacher has a way to do this because he has mastered the real essence, so he can introduce it with a small space.The teacher's consistent style in class is that he does not take hands, and uses his thinking to understand that he will not jump, and he emphasizes coherence. Even the mathematical foundation will come from scratch (here is physical mathematics). I can better appreciate why these mathematics is called physical mathematics.Then this course has the exercise lessons in the teaching teaching, and does not force the participation.

However, the teacher likes to change the rules. Students test the water temperature, (but the score is to ask the teaching assistant), and in the period, after the test, it also took 50%of the questions that did not appear in the test after the test. Although the content of the book at the end of the period is probably only half found, it is still the content of the class.Others: Teachers will recognize people, especially the electrical engineering department.The foundation is best to have Fourier transformation and linear algebra.

At that time Decide to mess with Yongfu's topic.My topic originally made the teacher's drawing (of course not just what to draw), and later gave birth to a special report, which contains almost all the content of the class.In addition, I also answered a question that the teacher asked me.

Therefore, the things that cover may not be comprehensive enough, but for EE students, it is still a good entry course. In addition, the landscape of the teacher's class is very beautiful.

Occasionally there will be Typo, and you may not understand if you do n\u2019t watch the videos in class.Classes are clearly clear, but Japanese -style English may need to be adapted.In addition, the quantum mechanics of the teacher is also well -known.

In fact, it is not bad. The homework is 10 points, the film is 1 point, more than 8, one is 0.5 points, and the round table is also considered a point.Don't care about him if the score is enough.If he is brave, the homework 10 is no matter he can.Other: At first, it seemed to be named after the first class, or the name of the get out of class, I forgot.Anyway, it was changed to a class name. Even if it was late at eight o'clock, it seemed to start to deduct the scores other than three times (forgotten).If you choose early eight, you ca n\u2019t climb too much attention.In the end, what I want to say: It is a very full class. The teacher is very interesting. People are very nice. They love to speak Raki. You can also talk to him as much as you do, but just a bit of what you want to do is a bit and a little bit. Cumbersome, not so good to play with abandonment.When the teacher will open the form, let everyone fill in the period, and then he will adjust it based on the content of the form.

After talking about the atomic structure , VSEPR, etc.Then enter the material phase.Gas talks about Virial Coefficient, Van der Waals EQ., Ideal Gas, etc.Teachers will always emphasize what is important in physical, like Van Der Waals EQ. It is an experience formula. There is no strong basis (later will be used to see it with Virial).Then you will talk about a bit of classical statistical mechanics, that is, Maxwell-Boltzman Distribution, exports some formulas such as the average rate of gas molecules.The liquid solid part talks about Viscosity, the state of glass, and the structure of the ice (there are more than a dozen fine structures of ice!) The solid is a bunch of tennis. Pack it out for everyone.I was a little fierce in thermalology. I only remember that when the teacher told entropy, the way was different from others.The teacher directly talked about the origin of Entropy from a micro statistical point of view, and finally introduced the concept of MicroCanonical Ensembell (only concepts, not difficult).The one -semester courses are ended with Gibbs Free Energy and Spontaneous Process.Class method: Write all blackboards, all English lectures, teachers will not speak Chinese.Very encouraging questions and discussions.Examination operation: Without homework, the teacher emphasized that everyone should write the questions selected after class (I did not write the QQ exam as the conference twice, and the small exams took 4 times. The small test was from the teacher. Attach importance to the correctness of science, there will be no scientific situation that the answers to the test like a high school will happen.

Most of them can be completed and paid at the end of the class. Group 4 people, so each person is only 2 minutes per person. The final score will be clearly listed on E3, stating that your scores are not adjusted with the total scores of this item. Finally, I scored 87 points.

Although I think Loading is heavier in English class (It may also be that my advanced English English is cool.) But I think I have learned a lot of things, and the class process will not make people feel dull and the teacher is very good. Students have problems.

The teachings are basically from the traditional computer opposition Alpha-Beta Search, I have taught at the TD-Learning of machine learning. I have taught a lot of computers for common methods for the situation. Personally, I think it is more like Topic Course. There is no coherence between each other, even if the order of lectures is mobilized, it has no effect. This type of course often appears in the institute or some advanced fields.Class method: Basically, the teacher will use his own slides. When you need to add explanation, you will use the blackboard. It is more special in the last month of the semester. I added the details of the \"examination operation\" under the details.Exam operation: When the teacher just started, the teacher's scoring method was Homework 20%Final Exam 24%Presentation 20%Program Projects 36%, but the teacher indicated that this is for reference only. I am not sure if it has changed at the end of the semester.Homework refers to handwritten homework. This semester has eight times, ranging from 2 to 5 questions each time. Occasionally, there will be one or two questions more. EssenceProgram Projects is that every semester teacher will designate a game as Project. For example, 2008 is a six -son chess, 2012 is the dark chess of chess. In the past 2014, in order to respond to the era of Machine Learning, Project The topics are similar to 2048 games. EssenceBut my personal experience is that as long as I write C ++, I have never practiced the algorithm and my friend.In the end, what I want to say: Actually, I searched it just now. I was full of the experience of this course. When this course was just started, it was full of many people. Finally, nearly half of the people retired, and the rest of the people There may be about 1/4 of the students of Teacher Wu Lab.I personally finish my thoughts that Project spend time, and when I find that I have spent a lot of time writing homework and Project, at the end of the semester, it is a bit in collapse when the Final Exam + Final Project + Presentation still accounts for such a high proportion, but I think As long as you write C ++ and take time to do homework, there must be a way to understand the basic knowledge in this field and get basic points. Of course, the high score may think of some non -professor or teaching assistant recommendation methods to let to make it allow Your AI Performance is better and needs to pay a lot of effort.However, the future research field of most people is not necessarily related to the computer match.

You can use MATLAB or Python in the following homework, which can be used directly with the function of reading and writing files.Each job must be submitted a report. In addition to answering questions, it is mainly to discuss what methods you use and the effect. Why do you use these methods and how do you write?

If you only pick one or two to write Write soon.Writing homework is full of interesting, but there is a disadvantage that the speed of homework this semester is faster than the class, and sometimes it will be taught after use.Final Project also has a large proportion of reports. The professor cares about what attempts you have made, and your idea. Code's Performance is relatively not so important. Final Project also requires Present to listen to professors and teachers in addition to paper reports. Home Just a paper report.FINAL EXAM can bring a computer (cannot access the Internet) and the book, and the teacher will also provide archeological questions. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand the noun of the teacher's lectures and archaeological questions. There is nothing wrong with the exam.Others: According to the teacher, the first knowledge of this course is DSP.In the end what I want to say: The teacher taught it well, and the concept is full. Although it is not very deep, the saying is full, and the nouns that should be mentioned in the image processing field are almost mentioned.

The classmates may have to refer to it, and the last thing I want to say: The biggest gain of this class is to discover sex / omnipipients, almost nothing, whether it is big or small, there is a friend who is related to sex / different aspects. Gender learning is not to swap gender, and then see if it will feel weird, but it is not actually the case, because sex / don't have to involve power, so it is inevitable Practice and attempts to change will always be more important than theory to wear non -gender clothing (e.g., for example, physiological men wearing women's clothing) can cause the substantial impact, which is definitely greater than in the heart that boys can wear women's clothing in their hearts. Be sure to force everyone to change to change. It is undoubtedly a great help to support the mentality of supporting those non -mainstream display. It just wants to explain that gender learning, or any science involved in power is by no means just simply simply. The conceptual game has pulled back the topic related to the course. Perhaps it is the restrictions of the guide -type course itself. Some are more difficult areas. The problem of that MEMO, six 3.x/5, the average score on average is very direct (the score of the final report of the group period is unknown), I guess the teacher probably did not adjust the score at the end.

Almost as long as you teach on online lectures and watch the video, the content of the video is basically two teachers dialogue and told the course.Not boring.The progress can be placed by 1.5 times.Let me have a lot of credits this semester, but the film only needs to watch more about her mother.It can only be said that they also take the super seriousness and help to compile and lecture.Basically, it is also very serious, and the lectures in the back are not satisfactory.Two physical lectures are generally in classrooms, which is also quite interesting.Judge Sanyuan is a judge who can understand what the students are thinking about. They really feel like they are. Interesting !!, Examinations: In the first period of operation, simple case analysis, check the information for one to two hours to get a small small after a week, there will be small small after a week. You can take the test twice !!! You can take the test twice, you can take two years of Jiaotong University for three years.After the test, the second time the wrong one was written for the second time. Basically, the content of the small test was fundamentally common. It can only be said that it is too simple. Almost all the questions are tested ~~ There are more than 60 points in the common sense of the light of the light.

When introducing the computer, XD, which is still full of CPU, occasionally talks about the current situation of the industry (?), Class method: Drawing film, maybe my problem is my teacher ... Also Full of sleep (Sorry OTZ, test operation: The test is 16%of the written test, and the on -board test is five and 84%. The semester scores are all test scores. There is a topic of high school national competition issued by the teacher once on the phone test. I feel a bit too much, although the question was announced one week earlier, that is, there is a week to study how to write. One or two small questions are named after the teaching assistant inspection (or you can choose to wait for the teaching assistant to catch the person in the department), but the on -board test is often related to the assignment. . After the homework is written, sometimes there will be bonus questions. Some of them have to write a program. Written test type is also a program that has been given a assistant to the semester. Will he listen to his lectures that he may still open it next year? Speaking of the homework, when I write a letter to send a letter to the teacher, the teacher will help you change the bug and write an annotation for you. When I laughed, I felt very sinister.

To find an additional to the Internet, you need to buy it, because the teacher will say that the first page of the first page, so if there is no book, it will be a bit troublesome. A lesson will probably have two articles. In short Method: The teacher likes to take a class in a question and answer, so he will ask for the content of the class before class to read the class. It is actually very short. You can read it in half an hour, but you have to answer his questions. , Or have found a similar analysis, it is difficult to answer the teacher's question when reading the article (or I have a dull qualification, there is no way to immediately understand the deepening meaning of the article is one of the reasons), but many people in this lesson feel that I don\u2019t think I read it. After the teacher asked, some people would answer that I did n\u2019t know that although the teacher was really good, he would laugh at the next one, but later he became more and more helpless. Appreciation is more preferred to the teacher's own point of view, that is, the correct answer that may not be able to answer the teacher's mind is not very high, so maybe the degree of freedom is not very high. Analysis should also be a report about Lu Xun at the end of the mid -term period. Then I gave him the detailed scores you modified every other week. I don't remember it, but in fact, there is no way to calculate. Others: The teacher will name it in the first lesson of the teacher, and then every class will order some people to answer questions and then will answer questions and then will then answer questions At the point of viewing other people, but according to my observation, the person who answered the question is usually his dark pile, that is, he really does not know much about the article. In the first row, the teacher would remember the name, because my name seemed to be remembered (even when I met the teacher in the breakfast shop, he could call it, so I was cautious when I ate breakfast) At the beginning of the festival, I will be ordered at least once in each lesson. According to my classmates of the same department, as long as the lesson they come, the teacher or me will think of the points, so they don\u2019t want to go. I feel sorry ... I heard that this class has a classroom participation score, so if you can, try to get as much as possible, which will also help the final report of the mid -term period. Finally, what you want to say: This class teacher is very Okay, but because of the text and discussion, there are actually some loading, but because I am not a text group, I may lack some aspects of analytical ability. I had to check some articles analyzing things XDDDDD before class, but I found that those I checked. Some teachers agreed that some teachers did not agree with it. It may be a more subjective part. You will know that you need to rely on the teacher\u2019s response and self -feelings to determine how many points you will get at the end of the period. All the homework you hand in the past will not have individual scores. There will only be the last semester score. Because, the results of this lesson did not come out the day before the start of the school ... It really has a long time !!!! ZZZZZZZZZZ The final result. In my efforts, I think it is an ordinary 8X point. The dark pile of the semester ... and shouldn't the grade give five points so late (error), but because my literary talent is not very good, so even if I say something, it may be common.

Therefore, in addition to quoting the new textbooks in the new textbook, the teacher will also use the textbook he used to use before he finds a good example question or a good proof to be used as an example.Therefore, if you only look at the textbooks, you may sometimes miss some examples or certification methods that are said in class., \u8003\u8bd5\u4f5c\u4e1a:Assignments (or Quiz)\uff1a10%Midterm exam\uff1a30% * 2Final exam\uff1a30%\u8001\u5e08\u4e00\u5171\u4f1a\u51fa\u516d\u6b21\u4f5c\u4e1a\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u5462\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u7ae0\u8282\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u8001\u5e08\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u662fThere are a lot of homework.

Each small question is calculated, and the number is as high as 60 or seventy questions. If you want to choose this course, please consider this.Although there is a DEADLINE every job, as long as you pay before the teaching assistant has been changed.The exam is basically not difficult. Most of the questions will be corrected from the homework. In theory, if you have done your homework, it should be not difficult to get a high score. In terms of scores, there are more than 80 points for three exams.The final score is that the teacher is more special to adjust the score in a linear way, that is, adjust the highest score to 99. It is recommended that the strong gods do not take this lesson \u310f and benefit the crowd.Others: Teachers do not name in class.Basically, many concepts on the complex function are developing from the most basic calculus, plus the original concept plus virtual number, and finally promoted to the entire plural space.Therefore, if the concept of calculus has a good classmate, it should be very good at taking this course.In the end, what I want to say: The amount of homework is really a bit, but the teacher is good in class. If it is summarized, basically I still recommend that you cultivate the recurrence function of the teacher.-"}, {"text": "Class name: signal and system, professor: Wang Zhongxuan, what did you teach: starting with the characteristics of the first system, then starting from handling the periodic signal of the cyclical signal, began to set off Transform, finally promoted to Laplace and Z-TRANSFORM, which are more commonly used in general systems.What is not the same as other teachers is that the teacher will extend this chapter until the end of the semester, and some lessons this semester have been released because of the holidays, so the end is a bit rushing.Class method: The teacher is a slot provided by the book dealer, and wrote his own annotation and explanation in the slideshow, and the notes made in the final class will be uploaded to E3 together.The teacher is very dedicated to teaching. Whenever he explains that when he finds the strange expression of his classmates, he will stop and ask and explain it. Although this is not a bad thing, everyone always does not express opinions when he asked him. For some point, it is a bit of a progress of the class.Basically, the teacher taught very well. In the signal and the system, each transform will have its characteristics and formulas. Although there are more or less similar places in different transforms, the teacher will still take every every way It has been proven once, which also led to his big disadvantage that he was slower.Exam operation: small test, one at the end of the middle of the period.The teacher will take a small test every week. The basics of the basic exam are not difficult. Most of them are just basic ideas. If you have concentrated on class, it is not difficult to get scores.There is no homework, but the teacher will put exercises and answers every week to E3. If you read the answer, you can find the assistant.This semester is more special. The teacher recommends that everyone takes notes. If you take notes to show the teacher, the teacher will help you add points.Some of the topics of the final exam in the mid -term period require some computing power, but the teacher usually extends the time for everyone. If you have the patience and take a serious class, it should not be difficult to get the score. In the next two exams, I took 80 points. For your reference.Others: Teachers will use small tests to name them, and sometimes they will be named as bonus.The need for the need should be the basic calculus and a little bit of differential equation. If these two subjects are fine, it should be very OK in this course.In the end, what I want to say: The teacher is a very serious teaching teacher. I hope that everyone can give back more when they are in class. This will not only learn more, but also accelerate the teacher's teaching.The teacher is also very generous to give the score, because everyone's score is not ideal during the mid -term exam, so the teacher also puts forward a notes that can uniformly do Laplace.-"}, {"text": "Class name: Professor, Professor: Wu Bingfei, what did you teach: This semester will teach the following chapters: CH2: Basic Concepts of Probility theorych3: Discrete Random VariableSch4: One Random Variablesch5: PAIRS OF RANDOM VAR Iablesch7: Sums of Random Variables & Long -Term Averages has a little rush because of this semester, so CH6: Vector Random Variables has no taught.Class method: Wu Bingfei is a professor who specializes in teaching opportunities.

Before the start of school, he must go to the filmmaking shop he designated to buy his lecture.As for the textbook part, he deliberately did not choose the Bible.Therefore, I can't find the answer to the textbook on the Internet, let alone the Chinese version of the book. I think there should be no one translated.It \u2019s fun to go to class. I do n\u2019t want to sleep in class. It\u2019 s very interesting. I will always give some examples of life to make evidence.For example, his most common example is \"going out about the opposite sex\" (because he said that gender is equal, and you can't specifically only say that girls or boys XDD) If you go out for the first time, you will not succeed.But you are not discouraged, keep making appointments until you go out successfully, this is called Geometric Random Variables.If you have a chance to go out to the opposite sex is 1/3, then you can get out 3 times on average, which means that the expected value is 3 times.Teachers will always emphasize not to sleep, otherwise he will be angry.However, I think this rule is the same as that, because it is quite life -like in class. In fact, I almost don't want to sleep very much.In addition to holding some strange life examples while class, the teacher also combines the chance of probability with some knowledge of the motor.For example, this semester he takes a maze as an example of an electronic mouse made by his laboratory as an example, explaining the meaning of PosteriorProbility and Prior Probability.For example, if the infrared Sensor has a wall in front of the reconnaissance side, and the distance is 20 cm, what is the probability of a wall?If the farthest wall in front is 50 cm, does it mean that there is really a door in front?In addition to interesting examples, the teacher will keep talking in class.Sometimes students under the mouth may sometimes have the motor department, and even the teaching assistant.Listening to him on the stage, he would not want to sleep with a smile.When various experience sharing and opportunities to educate teachers in class, in addition to teaching the chance of course, they will also share some interesting things he studies at the Jiaotong University and the United States.And these interesting things can be pulled back to the students' attention in a timely manner when the students are asleep.In addition, the value mentioned by the teacher from time to time this semester is to \"filial piety to parents.\"He often uses his own father's feelings, mentioning that his parents are very hard, and we should be grateful.At this time, maybe (no, it will ...) Speak at the students. For example, \"Mother's Day is coming, do you want a iPhone with your mother?\" It will always make people laugh.Examination operations: homework+40% of the 40% period of the small test in the pace, 30% of the final exam, 30% of the final exam, this course, this course, will not be named, but there will be 10 small tests in one semester. This part of 40%is 0 points, so basically every lesson is coming.During Quiz3, because I fell asleep, I was trembling every time I was in class. I was afraid that I would forget to go to class.There are about 10 times of homework.

You need to cooperate with some textbooks.The time of the two or two classes worship is two lessons that teachers flip teaching.In the time of these two lessons, the teacher will post the homework and let the groups discuss and do it.I think this method is very good, because through discussions with classmates and observing classmates' algorithms, we can quickly make up for weak ideas.However, if you do n\u2019t read the previous time, you may have a little effort to write your homework.At the time of May 1st, the teacher will take out the poor part of the previous homework.At the end of the semester, because the attendance rate during this period was getting lower and lower, the teacher later changed to explain the application of some linear algebra in the motor field.The teacher is very patient. When everyone is very good at writing homework, the teacher and the assistant church came down to help everyone write homework. If you have any or not, you can ask immediately.The teacher was very patient. Before I watched my homework casually, I used to write homework. The concept was messy. The teacher slowly explained to me, which made me very moved.Because this is the first time that the teacher has implemented flip teaching, she pays great attention to the feedback that everyone gives her.It feels like she wants to improve the method of teaching in this course.Although I ca n\u2019t classes on the two wonders, I am still very satisfied with such a class.Examination operations: Both section and small tests are not too difficult, and the basic right and wrong questions and calculation questions will be made for students to get points.The scores of homework are also very generous, so don't worry too much.Other: None, what I want to say in the end: None"}, {"text": "Class name: Digital circuit design, professor: Shan Zhijun, what did you teach: This course is mainly in the design of the logic circuit design.

Even if you do n\u2019t go to class, you will be self -study.During this period, it is mainly taught by logical judgment and simplification, which is the basis of the two -stage course.If this course is not learned well, the three -stage iron explosion.After the second paragraph, the class is mainly to teach the arrangement and design of the logical gate, such as how to design the most time -saving or most cost.In addition, the concepts of like time and FLIP-FLOP are also introduced, which are the most basic principles of computer operation.The teacher taught very well and taught very patiently. The class will repeatedly ask the classmates if they understand.Teachers teach in classes in class, and the lectures are well written. As long as the class listens carefully, it does not need to buy textbooks.Examinations: No name for class, but there are fixed small tests every week, it is not too difficult. The tests are learned last time, but for the sake of scores, you still have to arrive.In the section of the paragraph test, the teacher is usually in the evening test.

When you need to use it, you can get started immediately.Class method: Teacher Xie Seping is very kind, so that students feel very comfortable when they class.If there is a student asleep in class, the teacher will remind the classmates next to the classmates to get up to class.In addition, the teacher will share some of his previous attitudes in class. I think this is a very valuable experience for students.Teachers do not know very much in class, but there will be some small exams in class, and they also have to hand over some small homework.Sometimes I will go to the early nine -order class because I am too tired.However, the teacher's class is like listening to the story, so it will not take a lot of brains to drag your body to listen to it.Teachers often use some examples of life, maybe services such as Google, Facebook ... or some hardware equipment that are easy to see in life. Combined with these examples, it can make students easier Combination with life.In this lesson, I think the most important thing is the ability to think brought to us by the teacher, rather than blindly instilling the current Protocol and RFC to students.During class, the teacher will constantly ask us why the designer designs so much.Taking RDT as an example, because the RDT version is constantly evolving, the teacher will ask what RDT1.0 is missing, and it needs to be supplemented in 2.0 places, and 3.0 and 3.1 are also.Exam operation: Project parts are 3 C CODE homework.This semester should have been given 3 copies, but because everyone was backward because everyone taught the job, only two homework was sent in the end.The first job is to write a simple TCP chat room that can run on the Local.As for the second homework, it is to run on DNS Protocol, and then transmits a Server of DNS Query, which contains each person's exclusive cookies for teaching assistants.The assistant church returned to DNS Cert Query. There will be a string belonging to everyone, and then parsed it.I think these two homework is a challenge for me, because I have not tried similar coding before, and they still stop at simple solving.In addition, this homework is on the Ubuntu Linux I have not touched at all, so at the beginning, I spent a lot of time being familiar with the basic operation of Linux.The two homework actually took me 7 or 8 hours before I understood what all CODE was writing and their significance, but I felt worth it.With this experience, I will never be afraid of Project or Homework in the future.In the part of the paragraph test, most of the teachers are the concepts of internal and classroom teaching in PPT.Usually it is 10 questions. Except for some questions to write professional nouns, others are mostly short -answering questions. As long as you can give clear reasons and the ins and outs, you usually get the score.The teaching assistant is not very difficult to make students, so it is not too difficult to get a high score in this course.Other: Noth, what I want to say in the end: Good teacher"}, {"text": "Class name: History of East Asia Civilization, Professor: Zhang Wenchang, what I taught: Study the history of ancient East Asia, just like studying the relationship between China and neighboring countries.I have loved Chinese history since I was a child.

There are four in total this semester, and I have three of them. Significance, he wants us to think about the meaning of the film to express.In fact, the questions are very open, so it doesn't matter how to answer. The most important thing is to cultivate the ability to speculate.Princess Toyotomi is a film that I like, because his materials are full of real life, but it is full of ridiculous and fully point out the contradictions of Osaka people.I don't know the people in this part before.I also think the teacher\u2019s projection film is also very fun (maybe I have more enthusiasm for East Asia History!) He will tell the various contradictions, exchanges, and war in ancient South Korea, Japan and China, so you can use it as if you are in class. Listen to the story of the story.This is why I like this course.Examination: I like this course because there is no test in this course, just submit a report.Because there is no paragraph, you can listen to it easier during class.There are four reports of this semester, three abbreviated articles and an interview.For the abbreviation articles, the teacher will give 3 articles first. There are long and short, as long as it is abbreviated as an A4 paper.What are the exact contents of these three articles? I have forgotten, but it is very interesting. I can think of it as a story and then write it easily.The interview part is to visit the senior sisters and ask them some questions about the study of the Jiaotong University and the suggestions for their students.Other: None, what I want to say in the end: None"}, {"text": "Class name: otakus, professor: Teacher Wang Peidi, what did you taught: Introduce the history of the development of comics and the content of the house culture like a fan cute attribute cosplay.

It is like a stone monument full of text, which will make everyone think about why it is a text? Why is there no picture? Why does a map grow like this? Then introduce us how logically the social situation at that time was logical. , But PPT often jumps forward and jumps before and after. I do n\u2019t know where she is talking about.

There is only one choice. It is the content of the previous class. The test is quite fine. For example, who measured the height of the pyramid? However, I did n\u2019t review it again, and I wrote it by impression.At the end of the mid -term+report, the choice questions, the opening of the book (there are answers in the lecture), you can go online. The teacher changes the examination paper by himself.For the first time in the test questions, there are quite a lot of tests (the numbers of each culture), as well as logical reasoning (not if p is Q, it seems that many people are wrong ... I google on the spot), multiple choices seem to be many people Only one answer, so the teacher asked what happened. The second time there was a type of question change. The description of the question also changed the position. More new questions were added. Before the exam, I asked if there was a book with a book. Others: I should not pay attention to attending.

These homework allows students to practice by themselves. No need to make a small test is to use the last 10-15 minutes of the single quarter of each week. From the designated job specified last week, one or two questions are randomly tested to take the full score of 10 points for each time the full score is 10 points. , I took 11 tests throughout the semester, and took the highest 9 times to do the average teacher and said that this small test is a name for each week, and it is for students to review it for students. When a single day appears, this score should be stable, so when the teacher has the most class, it is the small test that, and other times ... The last part of my own is 9.4, at least it is very confident. It is strange that many people are too lazy to get this score to get the mid -term exam and the final exam. It is basically another world. The average period in the period is 42.64, and the average period of the period is the advice of the 35.38 comprehensive teacher. \"Not so ugly\" in the big test must at least write the assignments selected by the teacher enough. If you ca n\u2019t skip one section, you can go to the archaeological question system to see the teacher\u2019s archeological questions and then put on the question on the question. There are very few questions for the big test, only 5 questions, but each question is an extreme reinforcement version of the homework may be similar to archeological questions, but there will be no duplicate problems. \"Section\" \"Each question\" must write a certain degree of proficiency. My middle school entrance examination is not done. There are two sections of I lazy and I did n\u2019t take a closer look at the results of the two sections, so the final exam was blown again, but this time the test was 31 points, which made a lot of progress in comparison, but it was not a good result anyway. Many, others: As mentioned earlier, if you feel that your microblogging is restored or has not been repaired at all, it is better not to choose even if you are not familiar with the concept of calculus, at least you will have to solve it at that time.

It is probably the night before (I am XD), although everyone is almost the same It is a college student, and there is no work experience, but because the department from the department is different, someone can jump out, making you feel that he is really powerful or you can know some departments.

The fork then scored 60 points and shocked more than 50 candidates present, so the teacher settled in pain before setting up this rigorous rule BTW. This topic shows that the leadership style can be divided into the following four types ... \"Meow Lee, this is neither an examination management nor an introduction. It is wrong because the question will be the fourth style that does not exist at all. One or two questions that do not exist at all. Moreover, the topic is also interspersed with each other interacting and covering each other, false, false, false, and false, no wonder someone will take a whole time. The short -term memory of the night before. Individuals have vomited blood on the spot and died because they couldn't get any extent at all. It can be considered as the highest score of 8X and less than 90 points. When I came back, I returned to the test papers. Eight returned to the eight, but the teacher was really good to see the average class. So far, so -called Shengn is like this <(_ _)>, others: Teachers are very good to give the score in the mid -term final exam to help the tables and chairs add points and ask questions. At the time of class, I will bring some topics and then I want to express their favor or not in the class. As for the attending situation that everyone cares about, I did n\u2019t attend the school before the school was added to the classroom. People have evaporated halfway, but attending seems to be an important source of extra points for each lesson. If each class, one time after class, one time you are late, plus less points and the time of the late time is probably the time of the milk chef fried. Right and right, what I want to say finally: Because of the management of the management of the management institute, it was originally to play with other students in this class. It is worth noting that on Friday afternoon is to post a small note to write a small note to write from this lesson, please take it seriously, do n\u2019t you know how to answer it like a younger brother. Oh oh ~~ Oh ~~ Oh ~ the claws have learned that this is to be divided every week, and then the teacher reads this note in the big court to find someone to claim. Paqu's spirit stiffly comes to power and takes the stage seriously. Q_Q is very good to open a question.

The calculation will also have a special calculation method due to different specifications).The teacher's whole semester is actually very planned to be in the concept of the entire financial risk management. From \"definition of risk\" to \"important and instance of risk management\" to \"how to calculate risk values\" to the \"risk management system deduction \"If you listen carefully, you will find that it is very systematic.In the end, the teacher's slide will be adjusted with this week's major events.

Yes (20 questions are calculated), but the teacher still decides: open the root number*10 !!!

After all, the topic of each chapter is very helpful for whether it is a big test or a small test.Teachers' lectures are also Chinese translations. They are the focus of capturing the original textbooks, which is convenient for students to take classes and reviews. Personally, I think this lecture really helps a lot. For me, it is easier to read Chinese than reading English. Easy to fall asleep.Examination operations: 20%of the small test 4 times, usually 5%, and 32.5%of the operations at the end of the period only once, the score does not take seriously, but if there is writing, you can add points in a certain small test.A total of 4 times in the small test, a total of 5%of the semester scores. The first week of the small test, the teacher will specifically explain the films of some questions, and they will also \"show\" the probability of their appearance in the titles. There are all exams, so if the small test is too late to write the post -exercises, if you want to shoot birds and guess questions, it is recommended to be a special emphasis on a teacher.Although the teacher\u2019s small test questions are a bit too much, I often hear my classmate sorrow after the exam, but I have experienced the experience of four times, and I think that as long as you do cooked questions (so -called cooked refers to seeing the question of the question You can reflect the pen and write directly. You don't need to think of a lot of time). The amount and difficulty of the question are OK. I have finished writing and time to check.In addition, the difficulty of small tests can also remind some people to be written at the end of the middle of that period.Although the teacher did not hook the questions like other class, it would remind us to write the exercises quickly. Before the small exam at the end of the period, I wrote all the exercises of PROBLEM A (above), so there were quite enough to deal with the exam at the end of the period.At the end of the middle period, it is the common standard of the Management Academy, accounting for 32.5%at a time. Maybe because the teacher has asked our class to go to the teaching lesson, and also stipulate that writing experiences and notes, it is really much higher than our scores with other classes.For advertising, I really think that the help of the teaching lesson is very helpful. Some teachers have rushed to the end of the concept of the progress. The teaching assistant will be explained more clearly afterwards. The topic to meet, and each question is gradually explained on Word.Maybe the teaching assistant is closer to our age. I know what our stuck point is more. Sometimes there are problems but more questions to ask the assistant teachers instead of the teacher XD. Others: If you attend the class, you need to sign in every class. The teacher himself yourself. You will also click on the question to answer questions.This semester is the first time that the teacher asked students to go to the teaching lesson and write experiences. They have to go more than 10 times a semester. EssenceAlthough the starting point of writing notes and experiences is good, these notes must be sent back to the teacher, and they will not send it back. I think this is a bit out of the end.In the end, what I want to say: Teachers often scare everyone \"this is really playing.\" The final exam in the middle of the period is really not good. If you ask your classmates to answer the question and answer the question slightly or not, you will also say this time If you finish the exam, you have something to say about it. I personally think that this is a warning message, reminding others to go back and review and do exercises, and catch the teacher's progress.But scared home, the teacher often said some funny words, and the class would not be serious or pressure at all.The middle school entrance examination in the middle school exam is much better than other classes, and there are some rumors, but as far as I look, the teacher is really just familiar with the direction of Mr. Wang in the past, so he can guess the question.Then because Teacher Cai attaches great importance to the students' ability to compile tables in the exam, so we basically take a lot of questions about this kind of table to compile. Therefore, when the topic of Mr. Cai is written in the big test, it may be that other class is more comparison. In the place where pressure, but in fact, the account logic of the accounting of the hospital is really those who are really those. As long as you do a mature question (and you must really compile the table), the test questions at the end of the period are really not too difficult.In addition, the teacher has always emphasized \"cannot memorize the questions and numbers\". The learning accounting must understand the logic behind the question. The teacher has been explaining the logic of the problem. It can be thought on the spot even if you encountered the topic that you haven't done.After the mid -term exam, even students in other class came to listen to our class in class time, and they were all the end of the exam.In fact, after the mid -term exam, a friend of other class came to ask me a question, but what surprised me was that she did not even have the most basic accounting logic, so the question could not be solved.I think this is also the difference between going to the teaching lesson. In view of the rumors of the mid -term entrance examination, the topics of the two teachers before the final exam are super confidential. If there is no heart fault, at least 80, but I don't know that my grades are in the end.Then attach the grades and reference to the first two times of the small test. ) The semester score is 100 !!! I think the teacher dares to give points, and the moment when I see the results is startled, I thought it was the teacher's mistakes.I have never thought that after going to college, I will see such a high score in the semester. This is the first time I have touched the disciplines about numbers since my university. I must say that my mathematics is really bad, but from the score of accounting I completely regain my confidence, and it is really a lesson that must be paid when there is a hard work.To sum up this course, students with a large number of accounting departments are practiced. In our class, the best in the midterm exam is not the senior student in the management of the college, but the outer department.Loading should be considered ordinary. If you usually review and help the teaching lesson, you don't have to worry too much about small tests and big tests.Seeing such achievements, think about loading in this semester, and I really learned a lot, or I pushed Mr. Cai's accounting class."}, {"text": "Class name: Prosecution, Professor: Peng Wenxiao, what did you teach: discrete and continuous random variables: PMF, PDF, CDF, special distribution (uniform, gaussian, geometric ...) mean, variance, covariance, and related computing confidence probability rate Convergence centrally limited the laws of weakness and weakness statistics: Bayesian and Classic method, class method: sliding film is the main board book auxiliary book use books are IntRoduction to Probability 2e by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis course architecture and lecture. online Course is similar but does not teach Random Process.

I think it \u2019s very difficult to take a regular test: It is said that it is more difficult than the next door, but no matter how much it is more than grateful than the textbook exercises (but the score is still quite tragic) This semester is basically 0 ~ 1 basic question+ most solid part is not solid or not. Difficulty+ 1 question problem and then the problem this time will take the test again next time (but after the test is not announced in principle, it is not considered a delivery point) at the end of the period: The teacher said that half of the class said that it was necessary to come out, so it is said that the last finally said at the end Is it a bonus?This semester is to write a discluded random variable Convolution and then output it to Excel. In fact, the teacher's concept is quite complete and detailed (but I can't keep up with QAQ) Although the appearance looks like a kind senior, the teacher is a little unsmiling in private, but the teacher is willing to communicate and answer questions with my classmates Ask teacher) Personally think the disadvantages of this lesson: If the same is lacking in talent or probability statistical foundation, the lobby class + PPT + probability = sleep all the way, but there are small tests to follow the class, so you can not listen to the class, so you can go to class I am very tired, the teacher is quite happy, and often goes abroad to meet. So the course content, the scope of the examination and the test time, it seems that there are many differences in each semester. I do n\u2019t know if it is the advantage. As you say what you want to do, you have to prepare for your fucking. He is determined because the teacher's memory is super good. Remember that all the homework he said casually, and almost all the homework exams do not announce the answer. It is not announced that only the exercise homework and the first period of the middle school entrance examination are not announced this semester. I feel ... I do n\u2019t see the grades or ignorance. I \u2019m happy. The total score of this semester is also announced late (today), so if you feel that you may be regarded as a psychological meeting, it\u2019 s actually because of me. I feel that the chance is difficult. I see the results of this lesson that I can see the results. There is a sense of comfort that the Tiandong cherishes people ... I believe that the teacher has a sweet score for those who work hard. If the class experience in the shed next door is very consistent with the active person, I personally recommend that students who want to learn well, you may not help but complain, but this class is quite solid."}, {"text": "Class name: Signal and System, Professor: Zheng Sidong, what did you teach: 1.

The class method: The teacher uses a lot of pages to teach a lot of pages in the class chapters. The full teachings are quite clear, but a bit bland. In addition, the teacher often talks about half of his own HIGH laugh and laughs. His laughter is very interesting ww. Malware and trigger it and then record its behavior and write how to prevent the second assignment of the second job is to give a driver that can listen to Windows RW movements. Code Bonus is to find a way to prevent this program from continuing to move until it deletes its job network. There is almost nothing on this job network. You can check it. Finally, it is written to the trace code. The second homework is the packet that the two Wireshark monitors and the encrypted key told you to solve one of its encrypted content. In fact, the reason for writing is not to be solved (it uses another encryption method). The fourth job is to play TOR Then find a way to set up a server hidden behind TOR for the fifth time is OAUTH. It is necessary to implement the CLIENT side with Server's inspection website. It turned out that it was simply compared with what I returned. So I actually just put a webpage of the string of the string that it was checked.

Cultural and education, do textbook topics, translate single sentence sentences, and supplement a little related knowledge (for example, when you talk about earthquake resistance, you put a period of engineers who use the split -noodle test structure to test the structure). One of the texts of this progress chapter is one of the topics of selected themes. We report that the 3D Printer -Flux also reports that the group of reports such as the evolutionary history of the mobile phone should write a study single for key notes. Exam operation: At the end of one period of one period, the listening & pairing period of the textbooks appeared in the textbook. Because of the explanation of the first half of the teacher's day, as long as you listen to the class a little, you can get the high -end exam. So a small part of the first semester of the first half of the homework relying on myself, the two reports in the second half of the semester, the two minutes each for about ten minutes, forgotten, the others: I don\u2019t have to name it, but I have to sit in the position. The teacher used to teach the hearing, so the proportion of the hearing part accounted for a lot of different accents in this textbook (about eight Chengdu is not an American accent). This semester still chose this lesson to be honest and disappointed. The teacher used to teach hearing before, so he almost focused on the listening part, but the class name was science and technology English. In the background of the science and technology, the mid -term entrance examination is very outrageous. There is a question. The question is \"non -iron -containing metal\" written MG, W, li and other answers. The reason is that the teacher does not know if these elements contain iron. When I was added back, I couldn't get it back .... Eun actually has other questions, but the person who takes this question is about half a class. Generally speaking, this lesson is said to be itchy in science and technology. Advanced British listening feelings are barely OK, but the only useful thing that is not deep enough is that it is more familiar with many students who are familiar with the different accents.

If you take it, you will not understand it.The formula used during the problem solving will always ask the whole class. You can take the opportunity to review it, and you will remember many times.However, the teacher may use too many times. Remember to be super familiar, sometimes things come out directly.Pay attention to the integration. When talking about MOS, I will use BJT to compare. A formula will be pushed to explain him in some ways. I like this method very much. It feels fun to read the whole book after reading it.The teacher taught it quickly than other teachers. Those who have MOS are going to be taught. The class has just begun to go, but in fact, I don\u2019t feel fast, and the electronic experiments may not have learned that we have finished. Think of more things.Because of the faster, things will learn more than other classes, like a amplifier.The initial amplifier did not say that we said it.The teacher will always ask if there is any problem. I will ask more when I talk about the concept, but sometimes I really do n\u2019t have time to think too quickly when calculating the question, otherwise I ca n\u2019t keep up.You can also have no classes. If you have asked if you do n\u2019t have to write a way out? Teachers will also ask questions, sometimes one point, until someone says the answer he wants.Sometimes he will ask the question and say that we can raise our hands than voting, but the time is very short, so I can't think of it, so I raised it. Then he would ask why he raised it? Play, it was very slow at first, but in the end, the teacher simply finished it. When the time arrived, it was paid for 11 times, but in the end many people were handed in together, on the last class.Loading is not heavy. Maybe I have to keep up as much as possible, but it is strongly recommended to review, otherwise the teacher will not be able to answer the question, but it will not happen.At the end of the middle period, there were no small tests.Others: No name, but because there are only 8 people (4 electricians +2 electricity +2 land) he remembers, once the teacher said whether XXX did not come every time.In addition, because Lu Shengyou said from my introduction, everyone came to the stage, including teachers and teaching assistants.In the end, what I want to say: I really go to see Chen Longying \u2019s belt.

The detailed teacher's voice is a bit small, and the middle of the sitting will not be clear about what he speaks. Basically, the teacher's lecture is a bit fast, but because it is clearly explained, in fact, the teacher who needs to stop in the later lectures is much slower.

I ca n\u2019t convince others with feelings (probably, the teacher has opened a end, I realize it from other things) is very concerned about the students.

In the spare time, teachers are assigned to help teachers to bring students to read some classics, such as Marx's \"Communist Declaration\", sociological brain, and social science.The teacher is humorous in class style.

To be honest, I feel that even the fur cannot be touched, so there is no foundation.As long as you often reflect on the problems of this society, after absorbing the knowledge of these sociological theories, you will feel that thinking becomes more systematic and well -established.Even if you do n\u2019t pay attention to social issues, you will have interest in social issues after sociology.

Although the teacher kept intimidating us when he was in class, he would not adjust the points. He was used as an XD and he also heard some people who had studied the class. I think it \u2019s a lot of adjustment to adjust 13 points @@, others: The attendance rate is very miserable, and only about 20%of people will go to class each time.I am all diligent, and I have not been named throughout the semester.(In the impression ... I still have to forget it once.) The foundation you need. I think the data structure must be learned well, and the program ability must have a certain foundation.The teacher took the class with his own slides, but the content seemed to be the second edition, so some were different from the third edition.(Like the DFS of CH22) Although I am all diligent, I almost do my own thing in each lesson, I haven't listened to the teacher in class ... I finally want to say: each small test should be grasped, because the period and the end of the period and the end of the period The range is very large, it is impossible to finish two or three days before the test.I spend about 8 hours a week in the algorithm. Each time I consider him as a period of middle school entrance examination and prepare very seriously.Although it is tired, it is easy to make the middle school entrance examination and the final exam.I later felt that this method of testing every week was great, and I could urge myself to study, so that I would not be prepared before the big test.The algorithm is one of the core subjects of the capital workers, and it is also the subject that the research institute has pushed the must -see. We must take this course very seriously."}, {"text": "Class name: Development and society of the technology industry, professor: Human Society Pan Meiling Electric Ouyang League, what did you teach: the first part of the two parts is the first part of the two parts. Speech, debate, drama, and off -campus visits learned to stand in different angles to think about the problem. The second part of the problem is fair trade. Professor Professor Pan Meiling of Human Resources and Social Affairs is compared with the advantages and disadvantages of fair trade and the free market. , Reporting and off -campus visits to explore the impact of two trade methods on society. The methods of class: Most of the contents of the two parts are carried out in accordance with teachers' lectures, foreign teachers, off -campus visits, debates, reports, and drama. Examination operation: No test assignment is the information of the debate and report. Others: do not pay attention to the attendance rate. What I want to say finally: This is the first lesson of the Science and Technology Social Center. The training course of cultivation can be used to instead the content of the scientific and technological society taught by Mr. Chen Yongping. You must query a lot of positive and negative information as a debate, so you can tell the correct concept when discussing these current events with others. This is why I will push this course. Because it is the first time that the professor and teaching assistant of the professors of different departments are from different departments. There are many problems that have a big problem. Different from the teaching assistant notification, during the report, the teacher was furious that the theme did not meet the requirements of the six groups, only two groups had the rules of the teacher, and their message actually asked the teacher to know that the other group did not know that the teacher's handling attitude did not know the processing attitude of the teacher's processing attitude. Not good. This makes me a bad impression on this guest. Because no one has been scored similarly), it may be because it is the first time that there are so many problems that I look forward to the next time it will improve these issues."}, {"text": "Class name: Personal Calculation Experiment, Professor: Professor Multi-Device Collaboration Technology, Professor Huang Yulun, Professor Kinect Programing, Professor of Professor Wen Hongbin, Professor of Professor Machine Learning of Professor Jian Renmi. What did you teach? There are four parts in rogramming The Android section is an Android programming experiment to introduce IDE, Android Language, Google SDK, because most of the students have learned Java, so the small jobs explained in the explanation part will quickly bring this part to design a small SDK design of the Facebook SDK design of a small SDK. Program 2: Some experiments of Multi-Device Collaboration Technology are used to write the communication between the SERVER and the Client of multiple devices and some concepts of the HTML webpage. And The detected information is displayed on the computer 4. Machine Learning experiment content is to operate the K-MEANS algorithm. It is difficult to learn the tools of all technologies in four years, so the essence of the content of different fields in different fields must be used as experiments. Students must choose one part of these four parts as the topic of this semester will continue to with this semester. The topic of each Presentation Android is to write an Android App Multi-Device. Test Homework: homework is the content that is not done in the experiment or the designated topic designated in class. Others: Because it is an experimental lesson, of course, it will focus on the basis of the attendance rate. Basically, it is recommended to have a C ++ Java program concept C#(Kinect), what I want to say last: Very solid and novel calculation concept can encounter content in many different fields at a time.

Teacher pays great attention to the students' reactions. After teaching a paragraph, I will ask everyone if they understand or raise their hands.The classmates in this semester interact with the teacher well, and the teachers have become more and more like to interact with classmates in the class.(In fact, the interaction is just asking everyone if you understand it.) I think the teacher explains clearly. When the teacher finds that most people in the class do not understand, they will re -explain it again.However, when encountering some more complicated mathematical styles, the teacher often says \"Well ... Wait a minute, look at the roar ...\", and then stare at the launch screen contemplation for 5 minutes XDDDD. I think the teacher is very serious. Once the teacher was stuck in a mathematical formula derivation, (Texture Mapping) and the next time, the teacher wrote the derivation process by himself, and then uploaded to the webpage for the reference of the classmates, making me feel really serious !! The part of the OpenGL is also used by the taught, and it also uses homemade slides.The Dabu church tells us about the use of OpenGL functions, and then the most important thing is the theoretical part. This part will echo each other's class content.Then, the teaching assistant is really super strong. I think this lesson can give him a place to ask him anywhere, and he will teach you very carefully.Examination operation: 50% + small exam 14% + 18% in the middle exam + 18% of the final exam. Others: The teacher has a little name, but the attendance rate in this semester class is very high. 80 %, about 60 % on the day of a class.The basis you need, I think the basic matrix multiplication operation must be. This semester uses many matrix operations, but it will not be too difficult.Then, the program must have a certain skill, otherwise the homework should not be written.In the end, what I want to say: I think there is no self -study in this course. The teacher is talking about his slides in class. Understand.Then he has to take notes. Although he has a lot of content, he will only talk about some of the more important concepts. Those are where the exams will be taken.At the beginning, the concept of pipeline is very important. If you don't listen carefully in front, you should not understand it at all.The teacher's projectile design, I think that as long as I do n\u2019t understand it, I usually do n\u2019t understand it.So I have to listen to the lesson carefully, and I think this is why the attendance rate in the class is so high.I have only one lesson to forget to go to class this semester. (I am not asleep, I am really stupid enough to forget to go to class ==) basically can be regarded as full of diligence.Each class is seriously listening to the teacher's explanation, and also working hard to take notes, which is very helpful for review before the exam.(If you do n\u2019t go to the lesson, you will want to hit the wall before the test.) Then there is a program part. If you are interested, you can train yourself to write in an OO Desgin. Some programming principles can also be trained from now on. The things will be much easier when managing large projects.For example, this time I can eat a lot of scene files. Many people are engraved directly in the code, but the recommended method is to write a config file. The program read that config file, so you don't need to re -compile.If you are interested, in this semester's programming operation, you can greatly improve your programmaking, including some design models, software maintenance skills, etc., which will be helpful to develop large projects in the future."}, {"text": "Class name: Love and Marriage-From Classical to Modern, Professor: Huang Hanchang, what did you teach: 1.

The experience of mature love and the experience of being loved and reflection 5. Being able to love yourself, and expanding the table is this. Self -introduction will group class in the whole semester. Sometimes I read articles or watch the video and tell everyone to publish their feelings. Sometimes I listen to himself to speak a whole lesson. It should be regarded as a full name for many people. It is usually the experience of the film or the feeling of writing your thoughts in a period of the issue. A film report from the end of the period to pick a movie to explore a lot of miscellaneous things. What, the others: No announcement of the scoring standard said that attending is very heavy, but no one knows that many people have written the learning list in the second hall. Finally, what I want to say: I don't think it's cold and sweet ... AB is every week Be sure to get up in the classroom and write a learning single, and there will be a number of reports. There are eight reports. If he does not follow him, he will express your opinion on the ZZ class. How can he refute you, but if you are like this, you don\u2019t think __ Shouldn't it be better? There are any good discussions in the preset position = = So writing a report will be written in his position, otherwise it will be spent at that time. The heart power and the score are very low ... The mood is very poor in writing so much that I should be regarded as a full -scale writing. I have selected a masterpiece learning sheet. I only have about one or so. The time to pay is that the CP value is super low. If it is not a team member, it is very bad. One semester is really angry and some team members have any reports to the report.

Almost all of the exams are questioned from the hooking homework (so the homework must be written) is still full and the difficulty is not low; it is strongly recommended that the homework must be written, dragged until Deadline, you will write to cry (this semester Also hooked a lot of dual-number questions, so I wanted to copy the answers ...), others:-Teachers are very concerned about students, and they will gossip with classmates at class (?)- Teachers will remember their classmates. It is often tested by the teacher to ask questions, so it is recommended to be diligent. Even if the teacher is absent from a teacher, the teacher\u2019s book is small, so it is recommended to arrive early and sit in front of the teacher Especially at the end of the semester (there is a conference test), the book must be read early, but this part of the teacher will adjust it again; I have talked to the teacher and only want to give me sweetness. The personal teacher said that she would not spend too much more attention to those who only wanted to mix, and finally I wanted to say something: I personally have experienced something, and after a year of school, this semester is resumed. The calculus (1) I had a low score in the summer vacation of my college first; so I have always been worried that after one and a half years, I can keep up with me. I think it \u2019s very rusty but the teacher is really able to teach. After slowly recovering the knowledge in my mind, I can still follow the class teacher and assistant to help me. I am very grateful to them:) After 86, the semester score was 90 + (the original score class ranked 5th) with effort, and the results would definitely see the results.

After a year of suspension, the class was re -selected. The last semester was the economics of Professor Huang Xinghua (1), so I made a little comparison.For the above class: Both of them use briefings. The briefing content Huang Xinghua is relatively streamlined and clear. Xiao Jiexuan puts the textbook content more complete.For the content of the above lessons: Xiao Jieye is slightly insufficient, and the knowledge he heard carefully with the class alone may encounter a little difficulty when doing homework and question bank; of course relation.For the above class style: the two professors are very systematic, organized, and people are also very good. Among them, Professor Xiao Jiexuan made me particularly impressive this semester: at that time, the service trade issues were asking the students when the classmates asked when the classmates asked. His view, I remember he said, \"I am not convenient to comment on this matter, but I hope that my classmates can have their own independent thinking and views.\" For me, this tells me: he is a very good Great teacher.In summary: the two professors are excellent:), test assignment: Patriotic method: -Secant Middle Entrance Exam: 35%-Political Final Exam: 40%-job Test: 18%-Classroom participation: 7%homework is basically weekly. After one chapter, check the 2 or 3 questions to pay the questions every week; as long as it is paid on time and the content is OK, it will basically get more than 90.Two times in small exams are the way to get the question in the week before the semester (help everyone review) exams, that is, after -class exercises + question bank changes numbers and options. In simple terms, there are exercises.Other: The teaching assistants this semester are amazing, extremely efficient, and responsible; the small test after noon, more than 5 o'clock in the afternoon (handwritten questions ...) the final test results are finished The next day came out, and the final semester scores were also released soon.Teachers and teaching assistants will put documents and reference materials on time.

Some of the nature of Laplace conversion or the general table of the formula of the conversion formula is to forget how to solve (but know what to use) to see 5 major questions twice. Those) The recommendation of the reference materials is the PPT for class (with a note that can be found more quickly), and the general table of each conversion on the textbook (this is important !!) Moreover When the answer is helpless, there may be some use questions that will not be too tricky in small places to take large concepts and focus. The final score adjustment is adjusted according to the score high (less high -key) average is 75 attached to the level 90 ~ 1180 ~ 89 2170 ~ 79 1760 ~ 69 8 9, others: No name, the average attendance rate is about half? The basic part of the foundation is very helpful in part of Laplace. There are a lot of DSPs from the Institute of Education: In the future, DSP ... DSP seems to be the signal and system from Z Transform. Many sophomores are also related to the purpose of combining lines, micro -square, and circuits. If there is a repairs and changes at the same time, it will also find that the correlation is great. Basically, this course is full of mathematics but physical (signal) The concept is more interesting and important. From the perspective of the content, the first introduction is Fourier's analysis (total 4: discrete VS continuous, cycle vs non -cycle). Z transform is the promotion of Fourier's analysis (S Domain analysis). At the end of the semester, the concept of signal and system was actually discovered that the concept of signal and system was to the front structure. The content will be easy to make a lot of Laplace (PS: a bit different from this course) and the laplace solution of the circuit science."}, {"text": "Class name: History of Western Opera, Professor: Huang Lingti, what did you teach: appreciated the opera Monteverdi Montevil, Monteei, L'orfeo, some fragments of L'Coronazion di Poppea ) Some fragments Lully Lully, Armide, most fragments, Handel Handel Handel, Rinaldo, Introduction-Giulio Cesare some fragments Mozart Mozart Mozzze Di Figaro) After watching the whole drama, there seems to be a little jump in the middle-Die Zauberfl\u00f6te.

I often went to the scene of the car accident and had rich experience. Therefore, the teacher's experience sharing also felt particularly measured.And this lesson can make you more clearly understand what the passers -by on the road will see. For example, cars and large trucks will inevitably have visual dead ends.

These videos are similar to Discovery and National Geographic Channel. After the film, I will start to make some experiences and publish some experiences. Basically, I just name it. It \u2019s OK. Then the teacher is still full of kindness. \"The Influence of Technology on Humans\" must choose a science and technology to explore its history and use in the end of the period. \"What technology does human society need?\" Choose a technology that you think you think it should be developed or already developed. The impact requirements after development are all 8 ~ 10 pages of A4 PDF files (can be used in diagrams, tables, or REF pages) to report well (or voluntary) in the last week. In addition, because I just put the movie in the beginning of the two weeks, everyone sleeps into a piece, so after I decided to send a learning sheet to watch the video, I would like to play A+ A B. The teacher said that it was just a name, so these scores do not know? The four questions and one question are asking the five words you think you think are the most impressive in the film. Two questions ask some discussion. For example, \"With the development of meteorological technology, it is not a dream to control the climate. Do you think there should be a climate in the future? \"Impact?\" The fourth question is to write the deepest writing experience in the film and recover the class. Others: I must write a learning sheet every week, so I can\u2019t miss the class. I can only pay it after class. If you do n\u2019t need the foundation, although it \u2019s almost a science and engineering department, there are essay groups.

The film talks about the Peter Emperor and the Crimean War. The slides are matched with literature and food culture.Then the note should be copied. Although the teacher will send a letter to notify the title (noun explanation) before the small test, you can write it out on the Internet, but on the day of the final exam, you will get the score of the written record.When talking about food culture, the teacher has a Russian -made vodka and bread with bread for the whole class, because there are quite a lot of wine, and those who want to drink can drink the second (small) cup.

There are also 3 questions in terms of noun explanation. The comparison of the Communist society is written), and there is a question to write Russian celebrities (Ivan III and Alexander Nevsky), what they have done to evaluate him.In Russia's literature, I recommend Guogori's jacket and Chekhov's women with puppies. They can be written on the Internet and can be seen on the Internet and not too much. If you connect with history, you can actually write it. For example, these two works actually reflect the author's irony of the atmosphere of the times at the time, Blabla and so on.

Xuan's things will use a lot of metaphors to say that the matrix is \u200b\u200bvery full of content, but this course is really hard to understand, so it really takes time to digest the exam. I heard that it is a bit horrible. It is difficult to write. The first thing to solve the problem is to turn the problem into a matrix. The second thing is to do Gaussian elimination.

The group relied on her Carry (she was almost better than the teacher than the teacher), and then it was said that our final group report was quite creative and deep, so I also got a good result.

The paragraph is closed, so sometimes it will be dragged for 5-10 minutes of circuit learning content, so the rhythm of the class is quite fast. Sometimes I wake up and wake up.

Balance sheet or cash flow list ...), so you don't need To die, so I won't hate accounting, because Teacher Wang pays attention to the concept. He thinks that other things can be drawn with a computer, or running with a computer program.

Basically, the class should be answered in class, but some questions do not have a special standard answer. The scope of the applied question score is probably the 78 positive and negative of the 78 positive and negative. There is no prohibition to be late, but occasionally, it will be named, so I still have to go to class, and finally I want to say: a few lessons that are relaxed, it is very cool (it should be said that there will be no stress in class, you can absorb things inadvertently) Almost every week, almost every week is almost almost every week. Just go to the air and watch movies. XD, especially when watching movies, is full of a lot of people, and will accidentally coma, but the teacher can learn how to learn a lot.

Design algorithm for problematic 2. Analyze the performance of specific data structures. The basic concepts of Big-O, Master Method, Probability, etc. are mainly introduced. The following chapters are analyzed for different DATA Structure. At the same time It is very pure theory, and the content is quite abstract. It mainly discusses how to analyze the difficulty of a problem, and handle the Privatem from a collection point.Although it is a bit difficult, the teacher also speaks very clearly !! And it is the most complete and comprehensive one in all algorithms! The text of the algorithm Bible, after the teacher's internalization, added a lot of essence in it :) No name, and did not take the test (but remember to get the homework in the classroom), just Xiaohuang's leakage was leaked after listening to the case. It is relatively hard to say that Xiao Huang is really a rare teacher at Jiaotong University! (Of course, many teachers are great) Teachers are very concerned about the students' absorption of students in class. It is often mentioned that the course is very core. Some teachers will be very excited (or jump XD) and the teacher is very eager (?) The students use Office Hour to ask him the question. I know a lot! Not only the algorithm, the teacher C, C ++, PL, DS teachers are very good at. Exam homework: homework: This semester has a total of homework*5, each time there are proofs of programs and handwriting or handwriting. Compared with the operations of C ++ and PL, algorithm analysis is much simpler. I think it is much simpler. XD has to take some time. CODE also needs to go to the DEMO test: there is no small test, only one period of medium and final exams, the difficulty really concealed the difficulty. High, you need to integrate the content of the projects, and really take the time to think about the principle of the exam before the answer. The teacher also has a few questions to produce the same examples on the project, but not much ~ according to the observation of my classmates, the observation of my classmates, The teacher sorted the original results of the whole class. At the end of the period, the first place was 96, the second place 95, the third place 94 ... There should be another division method in the second paragraph of the improper person, other: \u203b The language that can be used: C ++ (because the algorithm of the work content is used for C ++), of course The content of the course is analyzing this.

It sounds intuitive, but in fact it is the command of the functional language and previously learned. Kung Fu is familiar.After the mid -term entrance examination, it is a wide range of theories in the field of databases, such as Transactions, Concurrency, regularization, etc. are not too difficult to understand!If you have a serious listening in class, you can understand the content of the slot. The way of class: There are actually textbooks in this lesson, but it is not recommended to buy it (unless you want to study deep) because the profile and textbook content used by the teacher is not right. = The jump is a bit chaotic, so it is recommended to read the teacher\u2019s projection film (the textbook itself is very heavy and the content is many, it is not easy to read it) Peng Wenzhi is actually pretty good, and from time to time, he will intersperate his experience or his own experience or your own experience. Small stories often told his story XDDD and the teacher is really nice! If there are no gods in class, I will ask his teacher to tell you carefully or discuss Jeremiabec together. The teacher still has the temperament of college students, and Chang Bao smiles very sunny :) After he is familiar with the teacher, he will care about your learning status!

I needed to discuss division of labor in their own group, or asked the teaching assistant or Google to find related writing. In addition to SQL Relying on self -learning skills (in fact, they are not difficult to grammar): There is no small test, there is a SQL on the machine, it is not difficult to be because all the questions come from the mid -term exam (just the answer to find it for yourself) the final exam, the final exam, They are all Open Book! The content of the course teaching and the opening of the book can also bring the previous archaeological questions and answers, so there are a few questions or just change the XD, others: \u203b I want to write it. Language: HTML, PHP, SQL (are all used in the implementation of the course selection system, SQL classrooms will teach, HTML and PHP have to go online to learn from the Internet, but HTML only needs to use it to set out the web architecture. The PHP syntax is similar to C, so It is not difficult to learn), what I want to say in the end: This class really should work well! Because the theory of teaching in the class is very infested, just let everyone have an OverView, so the place that can really improve strength is in the place where the strength is in is in I have done Project (but still have to grasp the mid -term exam, although the book is opened, it will still be a GG) webpage can be used in many places :)"}, {"text": "Class name: Combination Language and System Program, Professor: Teacher Cai Wenjin, what did you teach: chapter 2: IA\u201032 Processor Architecture Embly's basic elements: Symbol, Directives , Data ...)

Almost all of them are OK after watching it and understanding it, and the final test is still super Buddha's heart. There are several questions that are exactly the same as a small test XD, others: \u203b The language that can be used: Assembly (should be nonsense, the group of words must write a group wwww), and finally what you want to say: Although this course seems to have been cut, it is recommended that everyone can come to repairs! When writing, it will involve more hardware architecture. This is a high -end language that is less understandable, so adding more related backgrounds is also helpful when the hardware must be deepened.

This book is very small It covers many important online security issues in a rough way, and I personally think it is easy to read.However, the wireless network security part is that the textbooks are very simple and difficult to understand, so the teacher will use additional slides to explain it in detail.I also found a few books for reference to finally have a good understanding. Among them, I recommend it to see 802.11 Wireless Networks: The DEFINITIVE Guide, which explains very clearly.Class method: Because this lesson is in English, the teacher uses English almost all the way, the tone is very clear, and he feels that there will be no problems that you don't understand.In order to avoid hindrance to language difficulties, Chinese can also use Chinese when asking questions. Teachers will translate into English for everyone.During class, use a slot lecture. The teacher's pace is suitable, and the explanation is easy to understand.If you have any questions, the teacher is welcome to ask questions.In addition to class, the speaker has also been invited to come to give a speech, which is related to the program test.The teacher said that there were too many people trying to attack him, so don't send him to Email. Most of them can't receive it. It is best to call directly.If you have any questions, you can also ask the teaching assistant. They are all happy to answer questions, and the teacher also said that it is a very good student.Examinations: There are three middle school entrance examinations in this lesson, and the date of the exam will be announced at the beginning of the semester.The content of the test is focused on concepts, including short answers, analysis, application, and so on.You can feel that the teacher has a special selection, so there are almost no questions that need to be recited in large quantities. In addition, the teaching assistant is not too much to give points. As long as you have a certain understanding of the course content, it should not be difficult to get points.I usually watch the textbooks with the progress. The projection is listening to the teacher's explanation in class, and I have watched the textbooks and slides once or twice before the exam.Reading like this, in fact, the burden will not be too great.There are four small exams, usually not notifying in advance, but suddenly exams in class, usually only one question to two questions.It is mainly reviewing the nature, so it is not high, and the highest score is taken three times, and it seems to only account for 2 to 4 %of the final score.Although at the beginning of the semester, there was an assignment every two weeks, but there was no other homework at all except 3 Projects.Three Projects are the same as the score in one period.The process of Projects is different every year. This time the content is related to the related issues around BOT programs. There are some correlations each time, and the final integration is finally integrated.This is a group operation, a group of 2 to 3 people.In the first Project, the assistant church provided a BOT program. Students must observe the network packet connected to the server and record how to establish a connected message.The classroom provides an online platform called Cloudebug, which can connect Windows XP virtual machines on the browser and analyze the program.However, you can also use Wireshark to intercept packets.In the second Project, after the BOT program establishes a connection with the server, the message will be exchanged. Students must translate the BOT program, find the address provided by the teaching assistant, analyze the sayings and learn how to encrypt and decrypt decryption EssenceFinally, to analyze the packets, find out the message before the encryption.The third is BOT program, including three parts.In this Project, the Assistant Church provides almost written BOT programs and corresponding server programs. Among them, BOT is written in C ++. Due to the use of Windows API, the teaching assistant is recommended to use Visual Studio to edit. The server program is Python Script, but students do not need to modify the server.The first part of this Project is to fill in the communication instruction observed by Project 1 in an appropriate position and fill in the decryption program of Project 2 into a specific function, so that the BOT can connect with the server.Immediately after using the Windows API, two instructions: The server will send a file to make the BOT storage to the local server to require BOT to execute a specific Command Line instruction. Finally For reference in this area: The Ultimate Anti-Debugging Reference of Peter Ferrie An Anti-Reverse Engineering Guide has written the BOT program very well because the teaching assistant has been written in almost all functions and fills in specific blank functions and fill in Enter the content, and most of the functions are not long.It is conceivable to see a lot of effort to make a problem.I remember that the teacher had just said that because the background of the institute's class was not the same, it would reduce the difficulty of programming operations. Therefore, compared with last year's computer security profile, there are really fewer parts.The author and team members jointly write reports and manage files through Google Drive.This semester really wants to thank the team members for their help.Others: I usually do n\u2019t name it, just because there are assault tests, so if there are still poor classes, and the teacher sometimes takes some things that only have verbal speaking, and do not have things that have no textbooks and slides, so it is better to have lessons.The Introduction to the Introduction of Internet Security and the Introduction to Computer Security also overlap. If you have been on, you should be more handy, but because the teacher will not be too deep, it will not keep up with it if you have not been on it.These courses are all courses for the schedule.In the end, what I want to say: This lesson is very worthwhile in all aspects, teachers and assistants are very good, and the lectures are also very good.The test concept is the main test, so you don't need to recite too much, you just need to understand, but at the same time, it will not be too strict.It is not too difficult to assign homework, but it can make people learn things.In addition, the points are also pretty good.And in addition to the textbooks, some interesting news can be heard occasionally in the classroom.At present, the issue of Zi'an is really worthy of contact. The teacher also said that people with the background of Zi'an are very popular in the industry.It is said that in Taiwan, the security curriculum resources of the Jiaotong University are also one of the best. I really recommend everyone to take this course.-"}, {"text": "Class name: Digital circuit design, professor: Zhuang Renhui, what did you teach: 1. Digital systems and binary numbers2.

The teacher will explain the main content of today during class (although almost all of them have been taught in micro -accumulation classes that have been taught in lessons.

In the classroom, we mainly look at the topics of the maple file, and try to answer with various instructions (most of the professors have already made the answer, we only need to try the instructions), hit ourselves ourselves As long as the instructions on MAPLE are related to the topic, it is not necessarily answering the question. If there are errors, do not delete immediately. You can stay on it and try to explore. The focus is mainly on \"attempt\", not right or wrong.Examinations: There is a MAPLE file in each class in two weeks. Each class has a MAPLE file. After completing the title inside and trying other things, each group only needs to hand in a MAPLE file.It doesn't matter if you don't finish in the classroom, you can take it back to do it.Others:, what I want to say last: Loading is very light, how much you learn depends on yourself, there are some extra -curricular supplements, you can see it, but it is helpful to yourself."}, {"text": "Class name: Introduction to Internet programming, Professor: Professor Wang Xieyuan, what did you teach: At first, I first reviewed the introduction of the computer network.

How to supplement how to use workstations, Linux, GDB, TCPDUMP, VIM, etc. (In fact ...) After entering this course, pure C is used. Of course, you need to use C ++ No one to stop you from writing and writing from Socket. File Descriptor, TCP and other introduction Teaching OS is joking that he is simply in the work system ... After that, it is important to teach Select, Socket Options, UDP, IP, IO, etc. to teach Non-Blocking later.

I am used to Google if I encounter it. The film, but most of the textbooks are codes and picture professors are very detailed. The biggest interest of Professor is the Trace Code haha. At the end of the period, there are reactions to the student's response to the professor that this Trace Code is very boring for the strong to the strong. For those who are the weak, they have always talked about code and tedious. The professor said that in the future It will improve this main teaching style is the Trace Code. Through one line of explanation, tell you the use of the entire architecture for each function usage. Of course, there will be a page of the entire function of each function.

The string processing is basically a general level. This assignment is that the first operation of the assistant is that the assistant instructor wants to give you the first. The first is the chat room. The second main operation of the SELECT function is the UDP BINARY file, which is mainly to practice the function of UDP (ESTINT simulator developed by a graduate developer before the professor). The average of 95 three main homework is almost the 75DEMO method that is to go to LAB to run to the teaching assistant, and then be asked by the teaching assistant to see some questions. Contest is because it will record how long it takes you to pass 50MB of files and record how much you passed (because you will drop the packet to test if you send it to you will be wasted) The algorithm has a formula. The percentage of the strongest class to the person in the class is because of the disclosure of Final Contest (the previous homework is open), so when I went to DEMO, I did not happen when I tested. @@ It seems that there are also some people who have also been tested. WW (the successful rumor is 60 points). Because there is a big demon king in the class, he has passed the short because the formula is the strongest. In addition, some people It failed, and in the end, Contest had an average of only 66 on average. Although the CDXE test for a total of four hours, basically the professor and teaching assistant are very good. The time is infinitely without the Internet, but the lectures and CODE that can be printed. Or bring four questions on the middle and on -board tests of the class. There are three practical textbook examples. In the end 59, I think there is part of the reason for the middle school entrance examination. Even the first main assignment has not yet DEAD LINE. Many people have not even practiced. Archaeological questions and textbook examples, although there are only three questions that are really large changes, many people only write the first question and the second question Thread because the number of homework answers is less. The average class in the whole class is only 63 and the professor does not adjust the scores and does not make up for the test. So 57 people in the class were taken as 22 people. It was very hard. There are many empty holes in each staircase differential difference in the stairs (for example, there are 82 points left in the next 88 points). Others: The basis for not named is probably to write C, but there should be a degree of generalization. It is the Introduction to the computer network and the Linux system must be used slightly. What I want to say is finally: This year's assistant professor is said to be the best time to see if everyone will not be tied to everyone (because ESTINET will not The simulator is only available in the system) and then the course forum will help everyone to answer people. People are really good at the end of the semester. I think that there are too few lesson homework. Everyone does not practice much. If you go to the exam, you will only use the textbook example to change to the fact that it is completely different from the textbooks at the end of the machine. Cheng has a machine time to go to the machine every two weeks and go to the machine and go directly to the machine time to do the homework \"forced\". Everyone practice because this class is like a professor's first practice. Because many functions of this lesson can only run on Linux, this lesson has to use the Linux system. Many people usually use Windows. Use DEV-CPP to press F9 to end the result. Debug is not so smooth, and there is something that I can't meet. For a little serious more seriously to ask the teaching assistant or the forum to ask a lot of questions in fact, there are a lot of questions. After all, this class should also use 2030 I have n\u2019t encountered any questions that I have been answered on the Internet. In addition, MAN is actually very easy to use.

The teacher has said that most of us do not understand English because they do not understand the rules of Lianyin. The first or two lessons of flowers introduce the basic Lianyin rules (I personally feel super invincible) Teachers will use popular or classic English songs to introduce what is Lianyin (because there are many Lianyin for songs, this is why we often all often all all are After playing with English songs), with the basic concept of Lianyin, many English songs really understand it instantly. It is easy to use XD. This rule is also important for Duoyi or TOEFL.The teacher is also very concerned about everyone's learning situation. This seems to be a bit strange XD. It should be said that in a semester, the teacher will also arrange a few hours as us to explain the main points of the job interview, how to write a super god. Autobiography, the format or use of words and cutting methods should be mentioned. Therefore, if there is a deep understanding, the teacher will voluntarily use the spare time to help the classmates to modify and give opinions one -to -one opinions, which is super invincible and enthusiastic.There are also teachers who will also mention the \"\" Speaking, Writing Template \". This thing is necessary for the TOEFL TOEFL and interviews. Simply put With an exclusive template with \"personal style\", the cool XD, in addition, the teacher's content is really novel. Compared with ordinary teaching, the teacher tends to use the \"multimedia\" tools that everyone is familiar with to teach students, like song broadcasting The appreciation of the album clip and inspirational speech will have different expectations and surprises every class. The way of class: Basically, Mr. Qiu is a very young and nonsense and laughing. The playback of multimedia will also use slot or Word. Then what he teaches will not be very difficult, but it is very practical. Teachers often say that he used to be a student, so he knows what the student is thinking, so he will not make difficulties. student.Examination operation: There is only one period of mid -term report (one minute per person) in this semester. The theme is unlimited. You can participate in Chinese. You don't need too much Care grammar. What the teacher wants is the experience of content and English.There are no exams this semester. The final final exam that was originally formulated was also changed to pay inspirational experience (one page A4). It can be said that there is almost no less loading and can really learn something.

She often talks about her previous great achievements in the teaching process. The atmosphere of class is really easy, and she will make a surplus one during the lecture.

The program is written in C ++.The first Projcet was to establish a TCP connection with the server and exchange specified messages through Winsock.The second Project is to record the user's keyboard input through HOOKING.The third Project is a complete Key Logger and the corresponding server program. The program will test the keyboard input and then connect to the server. The result is encrypted and transmitted to the server through RC4.Students in this Project can also implement various extra points functions, such as automatic execution, hidden programming, supporting disconnection, and so on.Others: I usually do n\u2019t name it, just because there are assault tests, so if there are still poor classes, and the teacher sometimes takes some things that only have verbal speaking, and do not have things that have no textbooks and slides, so it is better to have lessons.The teacher said that the computer security Introduction is the most basic course in the security series. If it is completed, it should be easier to get started with other related courses.In fact, because the author has a cryptographic introduction in the compulsory repair, it was later repaired only the introduction of computer security.Both courses are courses for the schedule.In the end, what I want to say: This lesson is very worthwhile in all aspects, teachers and assistants are very good, and the lectures are also very good.The test concept is the main test, so you don't need to recite too much, you just need to understand, but at the same time, it will not be too strict.The homework does not spend too much time, but it can make people learn things.In addition, the points are also pretty good.And in addition to the textbooks, some interesting news can be heard occasionally in the classroom.At present, the issue of Zi'an is really worthy of contact.

These parts are good. From the content of the speech of these three different speakers, it can be easily different. I think the advertisers of the new generation It is more preferred to deal with miscellaneous affairs, and the speech will mainly mention that the salary is not proportional to the work content, and it must be supported by dreams. It can be heard that the main tasks of the advertising industry; speakers in the old generation focus on how to want young advertisers, and tell how to spend pressure to spend pressure, etc., can obviously hear the tone of the supervisor.Based on the above, if you are interested in the development of the advertising industry and the national industry, I think it is a lesson worthy of repair."}, {"text": "Class name: Return Analysis, Professor: Chen neighboring, what did you teach: simple regression analysis, variety of regression, general regression models, and their own relevant verification and trust interval.

It may be more difficult for people who have not been touched, but the teaching assistants are very good.

Use your computer to run things to show us that everyone's participation is relatively high.

In terms of situation, there are many things at the end of the small topic. Almost everyone stays in the laboratory for more than 8 hours. The FPGA test is taught by the final examination of another specialized digital circuit. It is not difficult to DSP test is the happiest test since I go to college. Only 10 questions are selected.

It seemed that I had discussed with him in the classroom for a long time. He seemed to be happy.However, if you send email to the teacher, although the teacher is said to be watching, it will hardly reply, so if you want to ask the teacher's question, it is better to face face to face.Exam operation: The calculation method of the score is the period of the midterm exam+the final exam = 60% (35% higher score, 25% of the lower score) three times the handwriting operation = 10% (average) program Project 1, 8-PUZZLE = 12 %(Program 7%, report 5%) program Project 2, dala = 13%(8%of the program competition results, report 5%) Basic score = 5%name bonus points = 2%.

They are determined according to the performance of the classmates, and the feeling of name is also temporarily.It is believed that the division method is also determined at the end. The original score can pass by about 47 points.The most important preparation of the test part is to write three handwriting homework from the teacher. The high proportion of the topic came out of the inside. Because the teacher started the first class at the time, there was no archeological question.Because there are too many text descriptions in textbooks, it is a bit unable to have a border, so the relative investment return rate before the test is small.The final exam seems to be taken in the scope of the middle school entrance examination, but there are not many questions.Basically, the exams will not be unexpected, so as long as you have read, you can get a certain score, but some parts are a bit cumbersome and may be deducted.The three -time handwriting homework is to write a question type similar to textbooks or examples, mainly from the teacher.Project 1 is to write a problem-solving program for 1-PUZZLE ~ 8-PUZZLE, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different algorithms such as A* or IDS.8-PUZZLE is a 9X9 square with 8 blocks with 1 ~ 8 numbers and a space. To move the square until the order is arranged from 1 ~ 8, you can refer , But it seems that there is an extra point (in fact, I always feel that there are two names, but the final score is only one time). If the search algorithm used by AI, it should be helpful if there are some foundations in the previous algorithm.In the end, what I want to say: I really feel that the general response of this lesson is actually not very good, but maybe it takes a little time adjustment because of the first time.In terms of grades, it is not too bad because of mysterious tuning.Although the part of the program special topic may take a lot of time to really do it, it can get a certain score even if only the basic requirements are made.Originally, the initial process of Project accounted for 50%, and it later became only 25%. In fact, it was a bit disappointed. After all, I spent a lot of effort to do it.However, although these programs are hard, it is also fun.Although the textbook is a bit ugly, it is very interesting.

About about One month of homework is from the topic of calculus teaching websites. It is important that it is very easy to answer the small test of Professor Ye Liming. Basically, only one or two questions will be posted. On the blackboard (or directly picking the title on the projection film), the answer is written on its own small paper. You can talk about the scope of the small test one week before the after -class, but the small test may not be in that that is not that in that. In the scope, sometimes you will go directly to the place just mentioned in class. As long as you concentrate on listening to the class, those questions can be killed (the answer has just appeared on the vir of the film). Forty points may be twenty points, or more than 300 points. As for the difficulty of the end of the period, the teacher pays great attention to the concept, so as long as the focus of each chapter is read, so that the 80 -point score is not difficult to get the problem in the middle of the exam at the end of the exam. You can ask the teaching assistant. The assistant church enthusiastically explained the meaning of the topic, and even provided the idea of \u200b\u200bsolving the problem (sometimes the answer was directly explained). Occasionally I order the name (about three times a semester) in class, but the name is basically used to add points. Finally, what I want to say: I really can't help but push this humorous and cute professor! Although there are many homework, as long as you can do it, you can really do it. After writing, the atmosphere of class is very easy after writing. Even if the attendance rate is low, or someone sleeps, even if someone is doing it, it is basically not stopped, but if you are humorous When it comes to the more difficult concepts, it will use magical metaphors to bring concepts into life, so that we can better understand that he only hopes that we can understand that the current class content is occasionally unable to solve the topic, and it will be silent. Interestingly, let's stimulate us to discuss the problem with him. Sometimes we remind him that he suddenly figured out, and he will be ecstatic and the total score of the whole class (really !!) As long as the homework is written, the exam should not be too ugly, the teacher basically does not basically not do it. Will be a person, but it is not clear how his score is calculated.

I have learned by myself and studied with a specific theme. It can also be regarded as preparing for the institute, or the guidance professor (?) In advance.But in fact, it is not related to the research institute and the instructor at that time.Students take 1 to 4 people as a group, and they need to find the topic themes of the professor to discuss themselves by themselves.Will each teacher accept specialists or places?Currently, 6 full -time professors, 3 each year, each year.So if there are already students in the last semester, the number of places will decrease next semester.In addition to finding a guidance professor by yourself, the department will also open information engineering topics (1), information engineering topic (2) and other courses.Generally, students will practice in their junior and senior seniors.Both courses will be held in two classes, and each year's curriculum teachers are not necessarily. In addition, if the students in the same group choose different classes, they will help together.In the junior and junior year, there are also other topics (1), topic (two). Because less people choose this period, they will only start one class.Before practicing, you have to submit the special application form to the department.It is not necessary to find a guidance professor immediately and take the class immediately, so most people usually start looking for a guidance professor early. In addition, it is not limited to a junior to cultivate. The classmates, the basic program design will be the topic, so it is impossible to start repairing too early.The method of class: The methods of the topic are different, but usually they always have to discuss it, then rush to advance and so on.The content of the special courses is that everyone made a briefing based on their own research, and other students listened carefully.Because the number of class I chose is small, it is reported by individuals (1) when the topic (1) is reported, but it usually uses a group as a unit report.The number of lessons in the later period will become less and less. Even when I remember the report, the students in the audience had only one digit.However, the topic (2) the teacher began to name it later, so the popularity increased again.The teacher has no skills to teach briefing, but after the classmates report, they will ask questions and provide some suggestions.At the time of the topic (2), the teacher is more special, stipulates a lot of formats, and even do SWOT analysis and painting UML.Basically, it is different from each teacher's practice.Exam operation: The method of scoring is mainly to have a certain proportion of the guidance professor, and the other part is determined by the course professor.The actual proportion may vary depending on different classes.The scoring standards are probably difficult to grasp, and everyone is not the same as the Fa. It provides the author's two lessons for reference: 91, 88.Other: The special lesson feels very free according to the difference between the guidance and the topic, and the difference between the things you do is very different.Some people do very complicated mathematical encryption algorithms; some people observe brain waves, some people study emotions; others are doing application apps; they also heard that some people almost look at documents and decide the research direction.However, it is said that the review committees of some scholarly classes have paid attention to the special results, so if the grades are not good, it is reliable and powerful to stand out.When it comes to the topic, there are four related things worth mentioning 1. The Student Student Student Student Student Student Student Student Student Student Student Student Student's Research Plan.The subsidy contains 32,200 personnel fees and the maximum of 15,000 miscellaneous fees. Miscellaneous fees must be used to purchase research related equipment as actual sales.Application is usually made during winter vacations.2.

If the cloud program is related to the cloud, it can be regarded as a cloud degree in the cloud!

Basically, the teacher is familiar with the teacher's class. The exams can be tested very high. Understand, it is not difficult to get high scores on the machine and not exceed the scope of the teacher's class.The number of object -oriented operations is relatively small, about seven or eight times.The teaching assistant class is several times in teaching Graphic Mode, Visual ... and the end of the first phase of the two periods.At the end of the phase, one or two groups of Project at the end of the period, starting from the eighth and ninth weeks, the progress will be checked in about three weeks.At the end of the period, there will be a competition.Others: It seems that many people have not come to class, and the teacher has named many times next semester.It doesn't matter if you don't know if you don't know the grades.The teacher is willing to ask you to ask questions, so it doesn't matter if it is not foundation. The teacher cares about everyone's learning status.In the end, what I want to say: I have taught in my homework, and I have gone for exams and teaching assistants.The final score of the plan is 95.I did n\u2019t get my best test during the OOP period, but Project has a good job in this group. The report has 99 points at the end of the period.So the students and sisters who have a bad exam at the end of the period do not need to be discouraged: D, make the topic! In the final topic competition, our group is a BLOKUS. Each group is great and interesting. Blasting king, dancing machine ...

This semester has only six people taking lessons. There are fewer people who have few people. Because the teacher loves to bask in the sun, when the wind and the sun are beautiful, they will be in the wind and sun. I will take students to teach outdoor. In this semester, I ran about five times in the impression. The teacher will write a book with a whiteboard outside and the breeze. Everyone sitting under the tree and feeling quite romantic!In addition to the theory of higher news, I have also practiced the teacher's news theory last semester. This course is more practical and more people cultivate. Recommended people who take pure communication can repair this course.People who don't know what the news theory is can google. Basically, this is a very magical knowledge. With it, there has been a rapid progress of communications technology for nearly decades.In short, I think the lesson of Moser's starting lesson is really a quality assurance XD.

There are two group competitions to answer, mainly to see how much students know, and there will be extra points for answering answers. Examinations: 1. There are 6 times Project (50%) Project1: Do a simple calculation operation Compiler, mainly changing Java CODE, to complete the homework, the purpose is to understand the 6 PHASES Project2-6 of Compiler's 6: It is the actual C-Compiler (simplified version C) Project2: C-Scanner Project3: C-Parser Project4: C-Type Checking, Declarion, Symbol Table, name Space Project5-6: Code Generation for C C-MIPS is relatively simple, mainly for the familiarity with Flex, bison, the function project4 is the most written the most. When Code, there are 4 weeks, but if you need to know how to start, you may have to spend 2 weeks Project5-6 to test the MIPS Assembly Code you produce. Action Routine to help do Type-Checking, operate Symbol Table, and produce assembly code because we Project did not generate Abstract Syntax Tree, so most of them must be in a grammar product, and the code, and and. Decide Source code is a bit different from the textbook (but you can also produce ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE, it should not be prohibited) 2. Period Entrance Examination (20%): Content CHPATER 1-5 3. Final Examination (25%): Content It is taught after the middle school entrance examination, but it will mainly be based on the projecting implementation part. 4. extra points (5%): I guess it can be opened at the end of the mid -term in the middle of another period like a class. Paper power, but not accessing the Internet, others: I think the foundation of the need should be more focused on the ability to design. I think it needs 1. C Program Design: Needless to talk about the basic instructions, but the ability It is important, it should not be used to complete the Project, and the correct use of Pointer, otherwise it will definitely dangling pointer. Memory Leak is flying in the sky. Otherwise, there are thousands of lines of CODE to search for a certain section of code. 2. Data Structure: Can you judge the list made of a Parameter, what data structure is used to deal with it, and each node must have those things. Only to store all information, how can we insert it efficiently, delete and search for information.I think most of the data structure used in use is not special (Link List, Stack, Queue, Hash Table, BINARY Search Tree), but you need to think well if you use it well. Only then can you solve your problem instead of starting to write a program code immediately. Otherwise, when you like Type Checking, you check the grammar and semantics of Variable Reference. Thousands of CODEs are slowly trying right? So you have to practice PSuedocode yourself, so you will not be busy. One point, it is easy to modify and expand. The program of the entire Project is added up, and the writing is 3000 lines and jumps, and the Project is divided into several stages, so I think this is very important, otherwise you will change the code and debug. 5. Will write it. Linux, Unix's Make File: Because you can connect several Source Code, Flex/BISON is mainly operating in Linux/Unix, so you must also learn to use the workstation, or use Vitual Box to install Linux. 6 Familiar with how to turn C Code into Assembly Code: Actually, you will talk about it in class, but the foundation is still necessary. Although it is necessary to use MIPS Assembly Language, it is enough Source Code, which will help you, will change it for you, and you will also write the Make File, but you will write it yourself. Turingmachine's knowledge is enough, because the class can be taught, and I have not taken a certificate, so I think it is really better to understand, but it does not need it, and the Compiler focuses on how to convert Finitee Automata into How to do the code, LL (K), LR (K) Parser, is actually a bit different from the things on the Formal Language. Finally, what I want to say: I think the teacher is very serious and cares about students' learning status. Explanation of his own way is not based on the disciplinary department, so the whole semester is very valuable, and he seems to be very good at explaining the difficult concept, which is easy to understand. It is really a good teacher."}, {"text": "Class name: Introduction and implementation of embedded system design, professor: Cao Xiaoyu, what did you teach: discussed in all aspects of the embedded system during class, including the principles of Bootloader, OS, hardware, development, and industry conditions in the industry. The board used for development tools is an ARM platform, and often uses the Linux system, so it will also mention that this part of the subject has audio and video on the OCW website to watch:, class method: Class is mainly to use a videos for class.The teacher is very good at talking, and sometimes you can talk about a lesson.Speaking is fast, the content is very interesting, and sometimes there are some experience.Although the content of the class has no absolute relationship with the experimental content, and there is no exam, there are fewer students in the later period.However, it is actually worth hearing.The experimental aspects are two people as the group, and each group will send a board and other experimental utensils.Find time to do it yourself, and then go to Demo on Wednesday night.Since the initial experiments need to use RS232 and Parallel Port, the recent computer is rarely supported.Therefore, there are additional opening time for students to use computers in the experimental classroom.Examination operation: Without the final exam and all the scores of the exam, the final period of the LAB and the final PROJECT decide the 80%Final Project 20%of the LABS Final Project. Each experiment must be submitted, and sometimes the original code has to be paid.At the end of the period, you need to pay PROPOSAL, Slides, and REPORT finally introduce your own topics in a briefing, and actually DEMO.Sometimes there will be an additional BONUS that LAB can do it. But the LAB score seems to see the situation of everyone to determine the score, so if most people do Bonus, you must complete all BONUS to get the full score to get the score in this course. The LAB3 BONUS allows the experiment that can make the score exceeding the full score at the beginning of the experiment. Because it is familiar with the environment, it is submitted every two weeks. Later experiments are once a week.Lab themes are as follows: Lab 1 -Environment Setup/System Installation/Hello World Create ToolChain on the PC on PC, including GCC Cross Compiler, compile Glibc, and record boot -up process, Linux Kernel, file system, etc. Wait and execute the Hello World program.Bonus: 1. Write the Echo program through RS232 and Host 2. Set the automatic execution of the program Lab 2-Bootloader re-compile INTRINSYC I-Boot Bootloader, add self-customized information, and add new repeatable function.Actually recorded on the board.Bonus: Study the lord code of Bootloader, and add the Non -OS Embedded Application to remove the unnecessary function of the IBOOT BOOTLOADER and reduce the size.The newly added file encryption function can be encrypted on the CompactFlash Card.Bonus: 1. Automatically encrypted a specific or all files when the CF Card is inserted.2. Perm the Uboot Bootloader to the PCM7230 platform 3.

To install the Linux operating system (can also be installed on Virtual Machine) and because the TOOLChain platform to be established is a very ancient version, so there are often wonderful wonderful versions Patients must be solved, or they have to use a very old Linux operating system.On the way, you often google to find the answer.## Since the RS232's connector is too difficult to find, but at the beginning, we did not open the computer classroom. We also went to Shunfa to buy wires and pick it out from the RS232 connector exactly on the motherboard.(If the host board does not have RS232 at all, it will be very expensive to buy the RS232 card, unrealistic XD) ## The experiment in the later period is roughly as long as you do it according to the experimental lecture. Ask the body.(Indeed, I have encountered many hardware problems.) However, when doing WINCE experiments, there will be some software that seems to be able to run on Windows XP.(Or maybe 32-bit / 64-bit, etc.) So I feel that taking this lesson has also been irrigated many operation systems (laughs), and finally what I want to say: Overall It is so hard, at least compared with the compiler of this semester and artificial intelligence, it seems that it is much easier (?) This semester should also thank the team members for helping so smoothly \\ 0.0//"}, {"text": "Class name: Introduction to artificial intelligence, professor: Wang Caipei, what did you taught: the textbook articles Artificial Intelligence -a modeln approach content is the textbook chapter 1-9, a little bit of the concepts of the chapter 18 chap, a little bit of the concepts.

What CHPATER 3 does the architecture of the AI \u200b\u200bAGENT feel like Searching that is learning algorithms, but it is not like an algorithm that can easily go to Improve its Complexity Chapter 4 to handle some Local Search and face a one in the face of a one. When there are multiple choices, CHAPTER 5 is the game-related AI Chapter 6 is the Constain SatisFy Privem. It is like the feeling of writing a solo game. Chapter 7-9 is the processing Logical Agent. Logic and their algorithm Chapter 18 are Machine Learning, but focusing on construction of Decision Tree. When you go back, you must read it yourself. You can pay more attention to some important details. Some lectures will be filled in after listening to class, but the textbooks should be there.

It is not difficult to want 80-90 or even 100. Once a name is added, but you do n\u2019t have to do it. Anyway, as long as you can read yourself, you can write it yourself. The implementation of the algorithm is very heavy, so the ability of Coding should not be too low. In addition, the profositional logic and first -order logic of discrete mathematics. Of course Analysis of textbooks, unfortunately not very important in this course ... In addition, if you are interested in some Agent related to Probability To this part, what I want to say in the end: I think the self -discipline ability of AI is very important, because the content of the class is not difficult, but it may encounter difficulties when it is done. It is something you need to pay attention to and deeper deeper about the algorithm.If you do n\u2019t pay attention, Agent may not be able to achieve the effect you want. If the test is a little bit, you may not be able to answer it, or you can answer it wrong, so I really feel that the design and observation ability of the algorithm should be stronger.And what I do on the AI \u200b\u200bis the best that you can write why 8-PUZZLE PROBLM must be solved if you are digging more than two holes, and the others are fine. I found that I thought the rules were too complicated before I couldn't write the program. I felt very regrettable, because this part was very fun.I had AI taught by Mr. Chen Yingping at the beginning. His homework was Pacman's AI. It was written in Python, but because it was online judge, as long as it was not written, he had to rewrite it. However, it seems that many people will not write, and the exams are not high, but I don't care very much, because I think it is so mixed in the past, I can't learn AI at all, so I decided to do it next time. Unfortunately Unfortunately.In addition, I have asked A*how to be more efficient in the Priority update. He provided two STL Multimap. I tried it that it was very effective, so I feel that the teacher's academic ability is not bad. This is also learned this semester to learn this semester. One of the good things.In the end, I did n\u2019t go to the deeper Probability Decision. It \u2019s a pity that the part of the feeling is very research and learning, but after he arrived at logic, I do n\u2019t know what he want Without details, I feel very boring, until the last Machine Learning feels more interesting, but unfortunately there is only a little bit ..."}, {"text": "Class name: mobile application software development and creative topic (the previous class name is Android programming), professor: Lin Zhiyu, what did you teach: Android SDK content is about the amount of the entire Android teaching book, Method: The teacher uses a slot lecture, supplemented by the program code explanation and the code DEMO DEMO explanation, but it has a wonderful accent (?), It is a bit difficult to express in words ... In short, you understand if you heard it after hearing it. In addition to the slides, the teacher's webpage has a PDF file with a lecture (?). The content is quite detailed. Perhaps because of this, the attendance rate is not very high.In addition, the teacher will upload many examples to his webpage for students' reference, which is quite valuable.Examination operations: 2 homework (15%each), a period of PROJECT (30%), a final project (40%) except for the Final Project.

There is often a copy of the rice paper component to go home to homework, which is written by the teacher.There are two study reports and reports from a calligrapher review.

For example, she asked, if you are Anna Karenina, will he commit suicide? If you are a king of a dynasty, will you support fighting, etc., easily answer :) There is no correct answer.The teacher's speaking audio is easy to fall asleep, but really can't fall asleep, because the content is very rich, the teacher is actually very funny.Examination operations: 40%of the small test, 30%group report and discussion, and 30%in the final exam.The small test is very simple.

The name of the final exam should write a lot because the question seems to be very heavy. I remember that there is a question: Where is the different ways of writing Pushkin and Guogoli, and then what kind of questions are similar.Other: The teacher has no name, but she has remembered everyone's name, so I think he should know who does not take a class and takes 5-6 times, so he has to attend 5-6 times, and then because the small test is admitted to the weekly, Therefore, the content is probably to attend 10-12 times, which means that it is best to attend. Haha, but the teacher gives a leave, so just tell the teacher.It does not require the foundation, but it needs to be sorted out, so it is enough.In the end, what I want to say: The teacher's score seems to be hit according to the score of the exam, rarely adjusts the points, because I have 2 to 3 times that 90.100 is 90.100, 2 to 3 times, 40.50 and then the score is about 80, so the small is small, so the small is small, so the small is small, so the small is small.

You can make up for it before the test, especially the speech, because the application questions must be examined.Exam operation: During the period (select+short answer+application) 30% Open Book period (short answer+application) 40% Open Book does not have homework, but if there is a reporter specified by a teacher, you will add points at the end of the report.Other: 30%of the attendance rate can be said to sign in each lesson (only when you have only encountered it in this semester, you do not need to sign in) Teacher said that you cannot sign on behalf of the handwriting, but you don\u2019t know if it is really fake XDDD. Finally What I said: I personally feel that I am still full of relaxation. Listen to the teacher's class, the speaker's speech, the report of the classmates, and then go to the test semester and end it.The teacher did not require much in class, so as soon as many people entered the classroom, they started to sleep or use their own laptops. In short, they were full.But if there is a little serious lesson, I think this course is a good opportunity for the science and engineering group to understand the field of communication.I don't think it is difficult to take the exam. Before the exam, the teacher will disclose a little test question. As long as the brief answer is to see the teacher in the class, the PPT can basically get a good score If you want to take it all, you must use textbooks.In the case of applying for the question, I impressed almost all the things I took for speeches and my classmates. The test questions only tended to write what the speaker said and then what you learned. Be sure to watch those video before the test. Good writing.In terms of grades, the teacher does not adjust the score, and the points are given as mentioned earlier.In my own scores, 84 (30%) 25.2 end 89 (40%) 35.6 attended (30%) 27.9 (please take a vacation) and did not make the final result of 89.

Of course, the number of voluntary times and the English speaking is relatively smooth. The classroom performance score will be relatively high. It is filming. In the impression, we have taken the dormitory to introduce and introduce the school architecture. There is another video. The teacher will hope that everyone will take notes in the classroom and record what she has in each class. In fact, there is still no XD at the end of the semester, so this part depends on whether you want to do it. Second, one -time middle school entrance examination, two oral report, and the other is the English inspection listening simulation testing period of the middle school entrance examination is to take five questions to prepare a little time (see how long you said before) Put a V8, and then ask us to record it by ourselves (no score is not recorded) Oral Report will draw the question in advance, and then the teacher will ask you to print the lecture with a computer first. V8 videos, and then in front of the classmates that you can bring a small copy to the last lesson, there will be a hearing simulation test, it will not be previewed first, but it is not very important. There will be detailed regulations for class (including regulations such as attending and distribution of grades). Because there are not many people in the class (only 19 left at the end of the expiration), the teacher will remember that the students will be caught by the classes. The absence of this time (the first two times did not deduct the scores), the score of the third semester after the third semester was deducted from B, but the absence of email should be sent to leave with her. The final score in English is about the score of the total score. To order the upper limit with the lower limit, then look at your original results to replace it with the score between the upper limit and the lower limit because the teacher will comply with the provisions of the school average 78 ~ 81, plus the gap between the upper limit score and the lower limit score will not be very good Therefore, the score of this course is definitely not a sweet impression in English. When she first started school, she told us that the score range was about 76 ~ 85, but I took 87 later The advantage of the division is that you do n\u2019t have to worry about being too bad to say that you will be used as XD. In the end, what you want to say: Actually, the teacher is a person with a knife and mouth. Although the student's good teacher is a bit heavy in English, her class is a bit heavy in English, but they will really make progress progress.

In fact, I found that many of them did not teach or taught the third chapter. The third chapter was the computing of the computer. After the number of digits, addition and subtraction methods, overflow, carry, etc., start to teach how to make a simple ALU and then teach the faster practice of multiplication instruments, but the exemption and floating points are all slightly more than teaching or not. After doing a digital circuit experimental Verilog, an alu is used to act as an alU. Chapter 4 is to implement a simple CPU teacher who can run the basic instructions of MIPS group.

The fourth job is to change the original CPU to pipelining, but such a CPU will have Hazard, so the fifth operation of Data FORWARDING, Hazard Detection is the first time.

Some thin things seemed to be in the past 6 and 7. When the CPU, the teacher specifically told us to print a few more teachers of the CPU's graphs and draw us along the various data paths. I think this is really great to draw him several times in class. I feel that the teacher is very enthusiastic about teaching. He always smiles from time to time with a smile on the class. He will also tell us with a smile and tease us with a smile. I think he teaches well!I almost understood it after I heard it in class. I would not forget it. I did n\u2019t forget it.

It is not possible for the winter vacation to achieve the seventh work, but in the end, there are only six of the hearts of Buddha ~ Although six), although six, the third and 5th are just a simple modification of the previous homework. The CPU changed pipelining. In fact, the burden did not have a very heavy third and 6th groups. In addition, I had to go to the Demo assistant to the assistant. We have a bug.

You can refer to 2.1,2.2,2.3,2.5. Classes are in this order.2.1 ~ 2.3 mainly introduce the unique theorem of the existence of high -level linear differential equations, linear independent solution base, superposition principles, and find base bottom with feature equations.2.5 is to introduce how to find special solutions to the non -secondary equation, including the unsure coefficient method and parameter replacement method.2.4,2.6, 2.7 is the application of the project. Many should be seen in general objects, that is, some mechanics and electrical models.MIDTERM1: CH1 ~ CH2 CH5 (5.5 does not teach): 5.1 is a system that can be described by linked differential equations, and how to convert the linear differential equation into a linked micro -division equation.5.2 is to introduce the use of micro -divorce sons and elimination methods to solve the micro -division equation. 5.3 is just the operation and nature of some matrix. It is more important to pay attention to the parts related to differentials 5.4 and 5.6 to introduce the base The part of the EIGENVECTOR (actually closely related to Jordan Normal Form) 5.7 is to introduce the meaning and nature of the index of the index of a matrix, and then develop, how to use such things to show a solution and how to use such things to solve it (Please note that there is a nilpotent properties, and it may be possible to use the definition of E^A ... soon!) 5.8 is not the second part, there will be fewer coefficients here, because the rules are a bit changeable and the process is troublesome.The most important thing is the parameter transformation method. You can find that the same means the same as the previous 2.5.CH4 Full: 4.1: The definition and existence of Rapras transformation (the only part of the class will not be permitted in class), and some basic formulas 4.2: a Rapras transformation with a function micro -score and points, which can be used to solve the differential equation equations Core 4.3 ~ 4.5: Mainly to seek anti -transformation, including translation, folding, micro -score and points 4.6: Dirac Delta Function. The physical application will use 3.1 ~ 3.4 of 3.1 ~ 3.4 of Midterm2: CH4 ~ CH5 CH3: This chapter is mainly the main thing is the main thing is the main thing is the main thing is the main thing How to solve with Power Series, there will be analytical, Singular Point concepts.If you are interested, you can go to the reciprocating function, and most of them are around these themes.There is also Frobenius -level number method to find some regula singular point -level solution, exception processing, and so on.Basically, the concept is not difficult, and the operation is annoying.8.1 ~ 8.3 of CH8: This part is only to teach the basic definition and operation of Fourier level, and to solve the simple PDE (Fourier Series) Final process. Most of them are very much like repeating the textbook content, but occasionally they still have their own views.Therefore, the speed of class is very slow, and it should be able to keep up, and if you have seriously copied the class notes, it is almost very much like reading the important content of the textbook, so you can use it in class. oh.Examination operations: 10 homework (1x10%), three exams (3x30%) who do not like the test must be very stressful ... but the content of the exam is very related to the exercise, as long as you practice the questions assigned by the teacher with a good practice teacher It should be able to master around 70 ~ 80 points, and in fact, there will be only some questions that do not have some exercises for the first time, and the other two are similar questions in the exercises.Therefore, the exercises must be done well, and then the exam should be taken to calculate the wrong mistake, it should be OK.In terms of exercises, some questions are not so simple, some need skills, some are more strange questions, and a few must prove it, but the exam is heavy skills. As long as you pay attention to some easy to make mistakes, practice more skills, find textbooks, find textbooks The questions with similar questions from the teacher (mostly nearby), even if you can't do some strange or proofs, it doesn't matter. In addition, the 10th big broadcast, there is 1 point in writing and submission.In addition, the topic of CH1 ~ CH2, please pay attention to the replacement method. Cauchy-EULER EQUATIONS, Reduction of Order will appear in the exercises, and you will definitely take the test !!, others: The teacher will not call it on time (5 minutes error 5 minutes (5 minutes error 5 minutes Inside), but you should not care if you come to class.Most of the basic single variable micro -integrals, and the calculus operation of the variables, individuals should pay more attention to the integral skills (Integration by PART, Partial Fraction), as well as anti -functions and hidden functions. Check the integral table of the appropriateness of the textbook., Finally, what I want to say: Actually, most of I read myself, do exercises myself, write notes for myself, and then see what the textbooks are said, which exercises are very special, do it, add other other The point of view of the book.In fact, this textbook is very good in the instructions of the principle and skills. It is a book with a very balanced dynamic and balanced. It is just slow.If you want to refer to other books, you can read: (1) Differential Equations with Boundary-Value PROBLEMS by Dennis G. Zill. If you just want Equations and Boundary Value PROBLEMS by William E.Boyce and Richard C. Diprima is said to have this book. In fact, the content is not bad. It feels that many things are not generalized. I am very similar, I will hook some special methods, special themes, and some that are prone to errors, but the class is very slow, so it is more than enough to slowly want to write it slowly, it will not cause a lot of pressure to me. I originally wanted to say that I wanted to say it. I originally wanted to say it. It is a pity not to choose Lu Xiaofeng or Yang Chunmei. The test accounts for 90%of the scores.

It seems that the answer is not very important.Then the class is very easy, basically he can listen to him, but it \u2019s just that the test and the debate of the week and the week are relatively much compared to other generals.In private, he will be patient with you the question.Examination operation: The only job is the speaker of the debate, and the score of the speech will not be announced. But the speaking bar is to write as much as possible. Considering the possibility of all kinds of possibilities is something that debates.But the teacher's intention seems to hope that we can try to debate, and will not include the real performance in the basis of the results, because when I debate, my head is still blank.Later, I also went to discuss with the teacher. He said that this was just the feeling of making us experience the debate.Explain the debate, that is, the teacher will make the topic to determine which groups are squares and anti -parties.The test is the noun explanation of the topic of the topic, and then applying the textbook to read the textbook is very familiar before writing it. Although you can get a little score with a mess, you still have to read to get most of the scores. After the entrance examination, I know which part of the textbook is the focus. The part of each unit theory is determined to be the focus and direction of the proposition. In addition, the exam may be for a news or article, but these functions are actually required to answer the following questions. Most of the answers come from the textbooks. Some of the rest are commented and narrative. The theory of memorizing and the above articles must be combined and discussed.

For me, the teacher's point of view can open many different levels of thinking. Although it is quite critical, I also read the reason why others do not like it, but after all, it is a social phenomenon and normal. Problems faced in stages.Then the class is easy, you can do your own thing, some people sleep, and the teacher will not order.Personally, I think that the teacher\u2019s class is like a person with life experience to tell you the problem he saw.

Too late the next day, sitting in the first row and sleeping to death, this does not affect the teacher's score. Instead, it is a decisive factors that spend the work on the homework.Because this course can be adopted for general or professional electives, the younger brother chose the latter after considering Loading, the actual course of practicing courses is very easy, and there will be no additional burden, but if you are students with more credits, you should choose carefully.

I do n\u2019t have a textbook at hand, and I only have some omissions by impression.) 1.graph2.isomorphism and Automorphism3.Tree4.hamility and Euler CirCuit5.Coloring6.planar Graph7.Connectivity8.Network F LOW (I didn\u2019t go to 99, but the teacher said I will teach in the future), the class method: The teacher has a sloppy film, and the content of the project is probably the definition and theorem of the streamlined version in the textbook. These contents are found in the textbooks, and the textbooks are written more detailed. The arrangement tells each theorem, and the important theorem will be described once, and the proof of writing will also be listed in the teacher. He welcomes the classmates to ask questions during class or ask him after class. : There are about seven to eight homework, and about ten questions at a time. All of the contents of the textbooks will not be proved. Some parts are operating questions. Finally, there is a program. The topic is then made with parallelism, but the teacher said that after the class may not have a program, it should be based on paper homework. There are textbooks or homework, others: No name, you just need to pay the homework or test foundation. I don't need it. I think it must be a little patient, my mind is clear, and I have to take time to think. After all, this is a math class. Finally, I think about it What to say: This course is not easy, so if you want to earn credits, I don't think it \u2019s a good choice when I was practicing. Although the textbooks were already easy to understand, there were still some places. The theory is not difficult, but if you can't think of the topic, you really stare at each other. If you are not inspired, you need to think or ask people slowly if you ca n\u2019t see it. The content of the teachings of the lesson is taught. If you have a mind, you will definitely gain a lot in this course!"}, {"text": "Class name: Constitution and Human Rights, Professor: Gao Shuren, what did you teach: Although the class name is constitutional and human rights, the content of the teacher taught is a relatively life -like legal knowledge.

The standard is, but in the end, there are 7 scores of 60 points. The average of 60%of the two PROJECTs each accounted for 20%each. There are 6 times in the second score. One test is one test.

Remember to take the textbook anyway ... Sometimes the example can be copied to the teacher to the teacher It seems that I hope that everyone has written all kinds of groups of programs that I have given at the beginning and the time is quite unfamiliar. Then he will not finish writing. Then he has a lot of questions every time. It is the content of his exam: 1. CODE who knows the group that you can't read (ask how much is the value of a certain time) 2. Write the two columns of the exchange matrix (keyboard input) \u2191 This The second is that many people mentioned above cannot write 3.

As long as he feels that you do a certain level, it is easy to get full ... (almost 60 are written, and a few are only 50). He only reads the result and does not look at the result. At the time, the scores were very serious about the Russian square. Project2 was a group translator, but as long as we make the List File part of the last, there is an error report (label does not exist or the code is wrong. ) He has written the part of the Parser. There is also a file that his data structure can be taken out as long as it is taken out. This Project is very kind. However, there are actually some problems he given to the CODE.

There are LED lights, buttons, screens, mouse, keyboard joints.Use the above switch as an input, LED as output, and do a 2-bit decoder.I was really excited when I got the board, and it felt very different from the software simulation.LAB 2 is to design a 4-Bit Comparator with Gate Level to design a 4-bit comparator.Lab 3 is a stack, which is similar to the example of another class.LAB 4 is to display a variety of different flashing lights with the LED light of the board, and you can also switch speed!I have encountered problems with boards here. The buttons often have no response. I have to change the board. I suspect that there are so many bad boards.After the later LAB 6 -assistant faculty provided the UCF setting file, it was not easy to encounter the same problem again.LAB 5 is a poker game console, with a draw ratio, and the software simulation is used to check whether it is correct.LAB 6 modifies the LAB 5 small modification so that it can be synthesized on the FPGA board, so that the two people can draw a card ratio.Use the LED lights on the board to display the size and victory, and use the buttons on the board to determine whether to draw a card.In fact, you can also play with the size of the ratio. = W = LAB 7 is the use of the knob on the board and the VGA connector to output a circle controlled by a knob on the screen.The input assistant of the knobs has helped us write it.

Others: I only ordered the name once and the bonus should not be attending, but the small test on Friday is the basis. I think there should be no discrete or discrete or scattered. Introduction foundation, what I want to say in the end: Because I am very exclusive to the pure theory such as the theory, I think it is full (pain) 75 I think it is very consistent ... It should be said that it is very willing to give it ... every week There is a small test, but it is still so heavy at the end of the period ...

The use of slides in the class just changes the typography of the lecture, and the content is to teach according to the lectures. There are often many examples to help students understand the concept. Important concept professors will definitely continue to continue Repeat until you are tired, the professor will also think that many concept sentences need to read the whole class together. If you go to class, you will memorize it. On the way, you need to answer a few choices of this chapter to download. The homework questions are basically simple and not tricky. As long as the concept understands, you can finish writing. The teaching assistant will send a detailed explanation immediately. The exam is in a medium -term and the final exam. You can bring a large copy of A4. It is mainly the concept of examination. Like the homework, you will send a detailed explanation immediately.

In addition to teaching micro-points, he passed mathematics in a simple way in this class. The concept of rigor.If the homework and exams are trying to understand it, they will feel very fulfilling.Class of Micro Cubing (theoretical group) -The solemn class method is the grouping, and then a mathematical problem related to calculus is issued every week (such as independent and fireflies, and the doctoral school entrance examination questions of a certain Changchun vine school, It is a difficult problem for the freshman. Let the group go back to discuss, and then take turns to report on the stage next week to report your solution.The problem in it is very inspiring, which will allow you to understand some of the definitions of the calculus and the application method very deeply. It is a great class.Linear algebra-Lin Yuan Bei teaching linear algebra is quite rigorous. They all derive from definition, and then through some magical proofs, we have obtained some abstract theorems.I don't know a nature and then there is no proof.The homework has a certificate, which is quite difficult.Most of the exams are calculated (because the test certificate will die), there are only some small proofs.Class content, homework and examinations often have nothing to do with the three.When I was studying myself, I was quite hard, and I didn't know what the meaning of these things was.but!When they slowly rise to the junior and senior, when many other courses, they will teach where the theories are used, but it is unlikely to go back from the theorem to prove it. At this time EssenceIntroduction to the dynamic system-Li Mingjia content is that after many times after the Function is overlapped, what will happen is related to chaos and non-linear control.There are only five people in the whole lesson, so the whole lesson is only a little time that the teacher is teaching, and then all the time to assign students to prove which theorems should be used as homework. See, there is no exam.The teacher is actually very good. I am a student in motor information. I am not familiar with some things in the Department of Mathematics. The teacher arranges me to do a few more questions with other students.This lesson made me see the complexity of the dynamic system and increased some of the Sense of mathematical proof.Random process (Research Institute) -In Chen Guanyu, I am not a student of the Department of Mathematics, and then I am not afraid to take this class in my junior year. During the class, I use many abstraction algebra, SPECTRAL Theorem, group theory, a little high, so I listen to many times, so I listen many times. don't know.In terms of content, the whole class is talking about some of the characteristics of his solution in some of the Markv chain that is not too complicated to be unable to analyze. For example, if you make the shuffle Model a Marco chain, wash it a few times.However, the teacher is very good. When you ask questions, you should go to find information, so in the end, it is quite harvesting.The mid -term entrance examination can be brought home to write. The final exam is a oral test.What did you teach: record not found, class method: record not found, test operation: record not found, other: circuitology-Chen Yongping is a good and serious teacher, calculate some example questions during class, and then go back to the homework and even some. Similar questions.It is a very solid class.Introduction to Digital Signal Treatment-Teacher Ji Tai Shi is very clear, the explanation is very clear, and it is also very concerned about the learning status of students. Most of the exams are also a good teacher.The linear system theory-Lin Qing'an course content is quite helpful to strengthen the linear algebra. When I was on, the teacher used a blackboard to take a class. It felt that the teacher was very familiar with what it taught, and the homework was quite difficult.Non-linear system theory-The satisfactory teachings of Teacher Liang Yaowen are easy to understand.

Chapter III is a simple combination language. Chapter 4 is the sixth chapter of the segment and calculation. The sixth chapter is culvert. Chapter Nine of Chengxiaocheng is the string operation, as well as the array (one -dimensional two -dimensional, etc.) Chapter 10 is the structure of the structure. The chapter is the system program. Chapter 17 is an floating -point number operation. There is also the professor's speech is not very loud. Any other is just what you just spoke. Examination operation: The original plan to be scheduled to be 60%is the rest of the small exam. It is a group of translators, but it is obvious that it is impossible to write in April and May, but the professor does not seem to think that he will be taught at all == (From the conclusion from me to ask him the question Saying this I will teach @@) But in the last June, he also found that it was impossible to write a group of translators and renamed it. Each array color is colorful) But in the end ... there is no Project in the whole semester because there is no time at all = = The whole disappointment result is changed ...

In this small test, there is no mid -term exam at all (the seventh test is still in the summer vacation @@ \u6b21 \u6b21 \u6b21) The fourth time is actually the third time that the third time the test can be replaced by the third time. Six small tests can be read to see the textbooks. You can take out the previous homework he gave to see which temporarily deposit or flags will be used for us ... I forgot to bring the textbook results in the last exam. I forgot how to write about the ZZZZ small test questions in class, so it is not difficult. It is a simple four -time operation or movement of three or four or two. The sixth time is the machine code. The seventh time is that the questions that follow the random numbers are often similar to the two small test rooms very similar to the two test rooms, so it is not easy to practice at a time. You can take the test next time (although you do n\u2019t know at the beginning of the period. If the small test is low, I will go home and rewrite it by myself. The computer can be run. I can take it to the professor to show that I can usually add points to the professor. Four times, four times after he has the special operation, and the average is the semester score because each small test is not necessarily 100, it is often 160 140, so it must be converted to 95 for a full score (I don't know why he likes to use it 95 When the full score is full, the second full score is 100) I average six times is 83 ... This lesson does not seem to be like a god of Cai Shen who can have a small score of 99 every time. The average is 93. My friend is on average 73, which is taken four times to 96 ... In the end, there will be a bonus point to see the impression or ask questions after class. Knowing how to get 3 points, it changed 99. XDD, and he has the assignment, but he is super simple. If you do n\u2019t care about your homework, you wo n\u2019t be able to recover pure points. Others: The attendance rate is full except that the small test is full = = do n\u2019t name the foundation. Generally, Cai Shen will tell us to write a group of words Cai Shen also taught temporary memory such as Eax EBP ESP and CS and other cosers. There are some basic schemes and schemes to teach in the system. What to say: The professor is very nice. I will ask the question every class and he will answer the question very enthusiastically and remember your name XD, but some questions tell me that he will teach the results in the future. I also try to interact with you, but everyone ignores him @@ ... I will take a class when I start school, but later I found that the whole class is often very embarrassing. I have a whispering answer because I sit in front of the professor. It seems that I have heard it, but I really want to say that he taught it very badly, but it \u2019s very shallow. It seems that Professor will write you what you say. From the score table, I guess that the 98 in the class have 18 retired elections. The remaining 28 are taken ... 10 people were originally transferred to the 60th class. The average was 55 points. The 46 average is 75 original scores (six small tests average) The whole class is 38 points, only 11 pass = = The final score is reduced to the original score (that is, the extra points), and the average of 46 points is added to the class.

Moderate, I heard that it is a bit difficult (?). At the end of the period, it seems a bit of water (personal feeling). Because the classmates are not very ideal, there are another make -up test, which can be added to 60 points.

The theorem or certification method (eg, the Intropuction to Mathematical Statistics of Hogg), and it is often said that these things can be used in the financial aspects, or which financial theory or formula is related to which things are related to the course. (This is the point I like very much), the way of class: Basically, it is a book, probably the example of doing some textbooks, or the example found from other books (maybe it may be thought), plus some textbooks The theorem that will appear on the top, and other books, she thinks that the important theorem will basically teach step by step. If you have any questions in the class, you can ask the teacher. The teacher is very welcome. Welcome to provide some suggestions. Examinations: There are three exams in this semester. There are 8 homework (to be handed in) homework, one at the end of the period (not needed), and the scores are unclear. The first six assignments are some of the topics that are added by the teacher. Some are HOGG's INTRODUCTION to Mathematical Statistics, and some are Ross's A First Course in Probability. I usually ask these books (Note: In fact But it is not so thin, but it is still deeper than I was in school at first, but those who should be the same should be different.) The two times are the textbooks, each time the question is at least 10 questions. Give 3 hours (of course, borrowing another classroom and ranking), the test will take some proof and theorem narrative (it will not be as difficult as high), and then there are some calculations. Question, but the title is that you can use what you have learned for the second 2 hours. It is more calculated. It feels that the variable replacement (after all is the distribution function) for the third 2 hours. Basically the test questions from archeological questions may be assignment, archeological questions, and even what the teacher thinks, may be remark1: Teacher usually gives archeological questions before the exam, and then it will be difficult to solve some of them in the week before the exam, but it will be more difficult, but it will be more difficult, but it will be more difficult, but it will be more difficult, but The answer and detailed explanation may not be given to ReMark2: The teacher will have a mistake every time the test papers. Because the teacher did not come to the exam before the first two times, she could not ask questions, but she said that if it was found, it would add extra points, otherwise the question in the whole class It is not counted, at the end of the period, the teacher personally monitor the exam. At the beginning The focus of the preparation and the best time to arrive the previous week, because there are not too many foundations to solve the archeological problem, but the foundation of the mechanism theory will be more adaptable. In the end, what you want to say: There are quite a lot of homework.In the later period, the topics of some textbooks seem to use the complex points and Stirling's Formula, but you will not write it. I am not suitable for me to ask the teacher. Should I focus on some estimates and various verifications of this course, but the teacher said that the students in the management institute are studying statistics first, and there is no chance of going. Therefore, this course has a lot of time. Like the rate of motivation.In addition, I often ask the teacher, what the financial department should learn and read, and the teacher is also happy to answer, so this makes me understand the learning style and thinking of the School of Management, as well as the financial subjects. I think it is a very special experience.In addition, if the topic will not be done, the teacher will give you a direction, and he is very willing to answer student questions and help students, so I recommend it.It's just that this course is not a person who has the right to practice. You can lie down. You still have to write carefully, class and ask questions in order to get high scores.At the same time, this course made me make up for the part that I had not learned the previous probability. After completing the full probability, I completed three books and then recommended three books: (1) a First Course in Probability (sheldon ross): There are many chances of probability and special topics (2) Introiduction to Mathematical Statistics (HOGG, McKean, Craig): Basically this is a typical mathematical statistical textbook, there are many relevant theorems, and the 6th edition will talk deeper than the A First Course in Probability.

You can practice. I think this resource is superb. The name of the dignitaries is late. Fortunately, I can choose the lesson in the last stage. So I am not sure if there is any special requirement to choose this course. Finally I have tried my best to master the scores I have tried to do my best. I did n\u2019t pay special attention to the last 89 people said that the ability was very low. Teacher, the teacher gave the score, it was very sweet to say that it was bad.

Picking a few groups to perform their own plots (all kinds, all strange and strange can be XD), test assignment: At first, the teacher said the viewing experience of mid -period+final+two professional music/drama performances (such as: at the Jiaotong University University of Jiaotong University Arts and cultural centers, county -city cultural centers, etc., presented \"professional\" group or individual performances), but the final exams in the final period use the opera experience of the opera watching in the classroom instead of XD ~ (The period is the classics on the classroom to watch the opera. At the end of the period, the teacher went home to complete a few questions.) The requirements of the two experiences were unchanged.Others: The teacher in the first half of the semester is quite named, but when you are late, you can make up for the name. The teacher with a high attendance rate in the second half of the semester has almost no name. Only the last class ordered another ending.In the end, what I want to say: This is a class that I think is quite relaxed. After about 2/3 of the whole semester, I will watch opera. When watching opera, the teacher will also add very professional and funny annotations. !!!! The part of the sliding film will not be boring. The teacher will match the opera clip viewing and the soundtrack of the soundtrack from time to time, and will also teach the classmates to sing together ~ I am very interested in opera The point of the opera, but watching the opera in class will be intoxicated and happy when watching the opera, although I still accidentally fall asleep once or twice@''@but it will not feel boring.The teacher is also very nice, because the competition has a leave.

The day when the group was going on on stage, I had to use the English for 50 minutes in English for the whole process. I felt that I would be ten times more nervous than using a Chinese report. When she talked to her in English, she always laughed and listened to me. Even after I finished speaking, she knew what XD did not think of how to say when I reported in English.

It is explained in the book of the book. Most of them follow the text progress of the textbook, but sometimes the teacher will give some proofs different from the textbooks.Basically, it will not be proven. It will be matched with some textbooks and do some textbooks after textbooks, and the teacher will convey what the feeling of these theorems is, and then start proof. The connection of things, it feels like it is to verify and apply some things learned from higher micro -accumulation.Therefore, I do n\u2019t feel like I \u2019m the theorem (and proof), and I can experience the proof.Examinations: There are no homework, two middle school entrance examinations, 50% of each teacher each takes the exercises after the test book, but the exercises must practice writing by yourself, otherwise the exam will be hung.The test time and scope are a little special. The first time is in the middle of May, and then the next time is the end of the final exam.The second test for the first test of the SEC37 ~ SEC52 (part of CH4) is the second time I take the SEC68 ~ SEC83 (part of the CH6+CH7) without the content of all the SEC 1 ~ SEC 87, but it will actually use it.The first test papers were helpful for teaching, and the change was quite strict. If you did not clearly write which theorem you quoted, or you did not calculate why you calculated the points, you can take the Branch Cut you set. It will be deducted 5 points. This time, there are 8 questions, so if you just count, you can only get 50 ~ 60 points.However, the teacher said that there were 26 people in the class, only 12 people took more than 50 points, so it was a bit frustrated.The second teacher said that he had to change it by himself. The topic came out with 6 questions. It seemed to be a textbook. Of course, he also had to practice it yourself, but I thought it would still be as rigorous to write as much as possible.But in the end, there are points for adjustment, about 10 points, others: will not pay attention to the attendance rate. If you have learned high equal calculus, you should be able to experience what the theorem is talking about, but the level of the first micro The test is calculated (even if it is proved, it is calculated), and will not go to the interior point, exterior point, open set, account, nested interval ... It seems that there is no proof of the \u03b5-\u0394 narrative class, so it is probably enough to be familiar with the beginning.In the end, what I want to say: The teacher will explain many difficult concepts in a relatively easy way of understanding, and will combine the content of the current course with other courses in a timely manner. For example It must be related to agency mathematics, and what narratives or techniques are commonly used are from the high micro, which will be mentioned a little bit, and the plural parameter points are the same as before From the class, integrate many previously learned."}, {"text": "Class name: Introduction to the database system, professor: Liang Ting, what did you teach: the textbooks used are DataBase System: Models, Languages, Design, and Application Programming 6th (By Elmasri) (I think it \u2019s good).

Later, and then give new homework, there are seven times a semester.For the first 6 questions, there were only 3 questions.Basically, it is not easy to complete these homework when you listen to the class content and read the lecture. The teacher used the lecture, the title was in the book.Some people may find it strange that the topic in the book should not be difficult, but the exercise of this book must be very familiar with the definition and nature of the probability, and you must feel a little bit of probability to know how to do it.So most of the first homework came out, most of the scores were poor.Later, the teacher felt that there were so many questions, so there were only 3 questions later.(Note: Don't think that the 3 question can be easily completed !!) Basically, I will not write most of the questions, but you can ask the teacher in Office Hour. The teacher will give you a direction, and sometimes even sometimes it is Almost put the answer, so use the time of Office Hour to ask the teacher.In addition, there are questions about the content of the classroom, and it is also best to use Office Hour to ask the teacher. Whether it is assignment or class content, the teacher will have a patient explanation.As for the exam, the teacher will only give 100 minutes, but if you can't finish it, give more time.And most of the questions in the exam will not be as difficult as homework, but the first question will be deliberately difficult. It will give you a model twice. If you can prove whether it is the Markv chain, basically you if you are nervous. It should be unable to think of it, because this problem often observes some basic facts and derives it.But other questions are some basic ideas and modified by the simplest assignment.(It can be counted, and it is easy to see how to solve it. Most of the homework topics are not the case.)

It often combines the content of other fields to derive the theorem, and Office Hour goes to him. Answer patiently, even if there are some things that exceed the scope of this course, you will also provide some directions to let you know what you want to learn and find, and he is very careful about changing the papers.

Most of them are examples of textbooks.The class is quite satisfactory in class, and the teachings are almost the scope of the conference test. Some of the more fragmented teachers usually skip it, and usually these will not be tested.The speech is very clear, but sometimes it will be too fast.The range of Wei was completed very early.When I was a little, I felt that the teacher taught well, and many concepts were very clear.However, when the second time, the contrast is very large. It feels that many difficult ideas have been brought over once.And the teacher sometimes counts wrong, (in fact, the frequency is still high ...) But it is usually a small problem in calculation. It will not let others feel that the teacher does not prepare lessons. Students who sit in the front rows will tell the teacher where the wrong is calculated. It's right.(Most of them are forgotten the negative number, etc.), examination operations: 4 secondary exam (60%), 1 conference test (30%), irregular name (10%) will be ticked after the end of each chapter.

Several times or even the entire examination paper is the topic in the exercise, and the numbers have not changed at all.In the last semester, the teacher will have remedy exercises after the first three middle school entrance examinations. The teacher will ask the question by ourselves, and then ask us to sign the teaching assistant. The score of the middle school entrance examination was added to the pass.There is no remedy exercise. I heard that the upper levels are stipulated (?), And the third and fourth paragraph test teachers are more difficult, but there are still a few questions.After the fourth period of the middle school entrance examination, the teacher issued the fifth exam. The question was the first four period exam questions+ 15.8, 15.9 exercises. The score ratio was about 8: 2.

The score should be (to the number/total number of times)*10%.The attendance rate in the micro -class was not bad, but I thought it would not need to go after the micro -range was completed. I did not expect the teacher to order twice at the end of the semester, and the total score was 4 points. The second attendance rate is relatively bad. There are only about 1/3 of the class in the class. The whole classroom is empty, but the teacher still takes class as usual. At the time of name, there are several exaggerations to the lesson rate, and the teacher still has no name.In the end, what I want to say: I feel that the teacher is very nice, but thinks more classic, and the way of class is quite satisfactory. Sometimes I feel very boring and accidentally fall asleep ... I feel that the teacher takes care of the students. The second time the second time also had a remedy exam.Some people have not arrived in the middle school entrance examination, and the teacher will ask the classmates to know if some people in the class come to call.After a while, the test was adjusted by 20 points, which means that the total score was 6 points. It should be because the micro -one test was too difficult.The second of the second was not adjusted at all. The teacher sent us to say that the decision of the calculus group will not be adjusted.Moreover, the teacher sent the semester results very early. It feels that there is no chance of seeking love ... In fact, Weng Zhiwen should be considered a good PASS. Although the adjustment is not large, there is a remedy method.

In addition, the teacher has emphasized from the beginning: Diagnalization Method of discrete mathematics is important, so if you hear it, don\u2019t be heard As a wind in the ear !! 2. In addition, you will feel that this course is not friendly from the beginning, that is, always define it, give the theorem, and prove. (The teacher likes guidance!)

Therefore, basically for beginners, it is better to read, and the Introiduction Totheory of Computaion of SIPSER does not emphasize the design of Automata and Grammer, but emphasizes the \"nature\" of these things, so it is based on proof -based. Of course, there is no need to say later. The calculation theory and complexity theory was originally composed of definition and theorem, so no matter who this course is repaired, it is a major challenge.

He sent me three times from one o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock in the morning.

Besides, the middle -aged men with more than thirty are not cute at all, so the explanation is not very clear.The first is that the teacher sometimes does not have enough lessons, so the whole lesson wastes a lot of time to study what he writes on the projection.Sometimes the teacher's explanation has been mysterious enough to make people wonder if he is a magical girl? Trial example: (looking at the line to be explained in the projection) Wu: \"hmmmmm .... HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM ... ..oh .... hmmmm ... oh, yes. \"(Smile, continue to talk about the next line) You read it right, the explanation has ended (doh), but I don\u2019t deny that the teacher is serious about homework and test papers, assignments, homework, homework, homework, homework, homework, homework, homework, and homework.

Ports is actually the easiest problem to encounter problems from the desktop environment of the original code installation graphics interface. It also takes the most time to imagine why this operation should be placed at the beginning of the period, because there will be no time to spend so much time in the later period to spend so much time. In the same subject, it may be because of this. In the middle of the period, I scared away a lot of people ... The first job ate my many weekends because it is easier to use a physical machine to be achieved, so I directly irrigated it. Even on the computer, even during the summer vacation, I preview the installation FreeBSD (when I was installed on the virtual machine at that time) through the 2009 course webpage, or I encountered unexpected problems ... (See the end Experience) After the first homework was handed out, I immediately used a virtualBox to repeat another FreeBSD. The fact also proved that this approach is the correct second job is FTP, and it is shared with Samba settings to Windows.

In this example, I want to search for English materials. Therefore, the English version is used. At the beginning, the keyword I used to \"FreeBSD FSTAB NTFS Cannot Boot\" did not find some seemingly useful messages, but I actually read it. \"NTFS Cannot Boot\" tried \"FreeBSD NTFS FSTAB\" and finally found a key article.

It is closer to the high school creatures to be deepened by the things on Teacher Chen Wenliang. A high school biological foundation heard that the class should understand that there is no foundation in the class.

The \"campaign\" still has to be verbally reported at the end of the final: campaign is to run a similar class in the class in the entire class. The final group has extra 40 points to allocate, and the candidate can decide how to allocate themselves (this year is a lottery) The content of the first class is to use a slot, but at the beginning, because there are campaign activities, it usually takes classes in one class. On the other hand, there are debts, street sweeping votes, voting, etc. I will watch a video. We are watching the White House and the monarchy. There was another visit to the end of the period. We went to the Hsinchu City Government and met the mayor.Examination operation: This year seems to be special. There is only one final exam in accordance with the end of the exam. The teacher will first put the question bank PO on the E3 platform. Then we can find the information first. Bring it in and copy, but the teacher also stated in advance that the words of the Open Book test will be stricter, so according to the teacher's statement, it seems that only one person has 8X at the end of the exam. Fortunately, the question type will have four noun explanations and two questions (anyway, just write as much as possible and have content).In terms of homework, everyone must have two experiences reports, because political science is also a \"root and bud\" plan, so the teacher will print some of the content of the king theory and let us write some experiences after reading. A good bonus will be issued at the end of the period.As for the group where you chose to participate in the campaign, as long as you submit an experience report at the end of the period, other groups must choose a report from the teacher to make a report for about 5 minutes.Other: No foundation, the second quarter of the teacher will be passed on to the order of the order, and finally what you want to say: This lesson is actually full of interesting, especially for the campaign. If you ca n\u2019t meet, the teacher \u2019s own ideas are also a lot of thoughts. During class, you also like to discuss with your classmates to discuss each other\u2019 s thoughts in class. No matter what exaggeration is, the teacher is happy to discuss with you, and sometimes he will still have it. It becomes a debate XD Sometimes you do n\u2019t speak, and the teacher will take the initiative to tell you to speak. It is recommended that you speak more anyway, which can increase the teacher \u2019s impression of you. This seems to add some scores at the end of the period.In fact, this lesson is really good. Although the teacher said that this course is not cold and sweet, but in addition to the less Loading, it is actually okay, because the teacher will finally adjust the average class to 78 +- The scope of 3, so if you write carefully with the exam, and then express your own ideas, the scores are acceptable."}, {"text": "Class name: Circuit and Electronics, Professor: Lin Zhengzhong, what did you teach: KVL and Kclrrl, RC, RLC and LC CircuitsIndal Steady States Analysisphasor NotationLaplace TranSFormCirciRCIRCUITS in s-domain, w-domain, t-domainopamps // diodes in class main The content of this book is produced from this book: \"Electric Circuits\", 6th ED / Nilsson, James William, the library of the library is abnormal, unless everyone runs to borrow it suddenly, every time I go to the library to study, directly Take it out of the bookshelf and read it safely.I did n\u2019t know at the beginning, so I bought one of myself, and even recommended the latest ninth edition to Hao Ran (the difference is that the color illustrations are bright, and I am in a good mood. It is also mentioned in it, but it can be seen that the form is more like from the book below: \"Microelectronic Circuits\" / Adel S. SEDRA, Kenneth C. Smith. I know why I ca n\u2019t check it now. I may not remember it. Although there are many books in the record, it is mostly reimbursed and lost. I have read this book before I have read this book. Although this semester, only part of the second chapter of this book can still be seen. I can see that although the teacher has a lot of things too late to teach. I feel that there are many things this semester. If there is a chance to come back, I think this department should preview in advance. It is to write a blackboard, and then everyone copy the progress of the class in the beginning is actually not very easy to catch. Often at the beginning of the chapters jump, everyone may not have entered the situation. That chapter will take the test, and that chapter will not expect that the classmate will look at the class when he is going back.

I can circulate among the younger brothers and sisters in the future. It becomes a legend that I want to write, but I forgot ..., Examinations: This semester test six tests this semester, no other homework on the course website There are previous archaeological teachers that the previous exams were not in class, as if they did not respond well, so this semester was in the class time. The test may be because of this. In fact, almost only the last two small tests at the end of the circuit semester were squeezed in the same week at the end of the semester, and the progress of the progress was quite rushing. You can find that if the teacher passed the circuit once, it usually uses the same question type. Most of the exercises on the secondary circuit book are numbered again, and the teacher\u2019s test questions are all unknown to indicate that it may not be accustomed to the beginning. Others: Basically, the teacher will not name it. After class, the individual who has not copied notes has been copied notes. At first, the teacher's class method has not followed the teacher\u2019s class. Although it is only barely passing, but not too much alert. The second test was very bad. To solve this problem, remember that I was willing to say that the remaining small tests were fully scored (although they did not reach it, they had to cultivate their own differential equations (although the result was only read the first chapter, but there was still a way to save it. Just look at the textbooks, plus the previous test papers once again.During a certain class, the teacher suddenly taught the previous progress in the textbook. It also made me unexpectedly discover that the class method that suits me is very fast. Sometimes the teacher is quite fast. I do n\u2019t think about it, it is best to read the textbook before class, and read the part of the teacher's teachings in advance (unfortunate When the teacher starts to solve the problem, it is best to solve it with the teacher, and find a way to solve it faster than the teacher.In this way, you can easily grab a part of the bonus questions, and writing questions will also help improve your focus.At the same time, the topic of the teacher's class is also likely to be test questions. Practicing in advance should be helpful. Although the first test of the first test can be said to be based on the solution of the differential equation, but it should be only foundation. There are also personal experience in the textbook. The differential equation should not have much impact. What I want to say: When I ask the teacher questions after class, the teacher will enthusiastically answer that I feel that the teacher is very concerned about the students who are very concerned about the students. The fake teacher agreed at a bite. I really thanked the teacher for remembing the penultimate exam. When I discussed with my classmates before the test, I suddenly found that I did not re -write the test paper on the test paper. It is a similar question type.Somehow, the mood at that time was very irritable. After writing the topics you should get, he suddenly had no motivation to solve other problems.That's it, I want to make the test papers early, so I go back to study other subjects, maybe ... when I have this idea, I have lost it.

He also said that letting us do a topic is to let us go to the game, because 8051 is widely used.We all saw Tim Fook's good intentions.When it comes to home, it will take three weeks.At LAB10, you have to report the theme you want to do with your teacher and teaching assistant. If you are too simple, you will be proposed if you are too difficult.Then spend two weeks to do your topic. Finally, in the last experimental lesson, you need to go to the stage to explain your topic and explain your position to show your topic.

Because of the urgent relationship, Chapter 6 I did not teach very carefully, and the teaching was more focused from chapters 3 to 5.Class method: The professor mainly uses slides to class. Occasionally some certifications will be written in books, which are generally clear. Sometimes speaking will always ask students in a questioning tone and guide students to answer Answer, so sometimes the class will be stiff at the teacher's time, and the professor will still explain very clearly.The professor's traces are good, and the important concepts will talk about it again. For example, Excel's statistical operation will continue to operate in the classroom, and it will also give students many Excel files to practice. It will be very patient to explain to the students.Compared with Excel, R software is a little less.

Most of the topics must be key and understand which analysis of the meaning of the question, and then the professor will ask what the operation of Excel should be written in the answer book, so as not to give the answer wrong and give some scores.Other: I have not been named throughout the semester. If you feel that you can do it, you can not have to go to class. Before the middle school entrance examination, he was almost a chance to review. The second half focused on statistics. Because the teacher would talk about Excel's operation and operation in the classroom Some examples, so I didn't hear it.I personally think that it would be better to go to people who have a chance to repair. In this case, the probability of reviewing the first half of the semester will be easier, and the second semester will be more focused on statistical analysis.In the end, what I want to say: The teacher asked everyone to learn from the beginning of the class \"or\" the practicality in the workplace \"is mainly because of the more difficult paper and pen calculation of Zheng Ming and the example. For the application of the operation and actual examples, the teacher will give you 1 to 2 weeks to consider, and then please vote in the whole class.Our class tends to the latter, so the professor will explain more on software operations such as Excel and R, and there will be a test at the end of the semester.Personally, I think it is a good professor.
